It presupposes that the AI is not just a tool for writing code but an autonomous actor capable of planning, executing, validating, and iterating on complex engineering tasks with minimal human intervention.\nL141: ### **What you'll learn**\nL142: * Installing and configuring Antigravity\nL143: * Exploring key concepts of Antigravity like Agent Manager, Editor, Browser and more\nL144: * Exploring a few use cases with Antigravity\nL145: ### **What you'll need**\nL146: Currently Antigravity is available as a preview for personal Gmail accounts. It comes with a free quota to use premier models.\nL147: Antigravity needs to be locally installed on your system. The product is available on Mac, Windows and specific Linux distributions.

</details>
いいですね、この問いは「VIBEプロジェクト」の知識を「全部ちゃんと読んで、その上でフォルダ運用をどう最大化するか」を考える、まさに核になる質問だと思います。

まずは結論からざっくりまとめます。

## ざっくり結論（「どう運用を最大化するか」の方向性）

- このVIBEプロジェクトKBは、「1フォルダ完結のバイブコーディングOS」を作るためのかなり完成度の高い設計セットです。
- 中身は大きく分けると：
  - プロセス・フロー設計（OneBox / VIBE_CTRL / ステートマシン）
  - RAG・KB設計（VAULT / KB/AI_READY / Focus Pack）
  - AIエージェント連携設計（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor など）
  - ガバナンス・安全性（ゲート・免除・監査）
  - 自己進化・学び回収（LESSON → Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲート）
- フォルダ運用を最大化するために「今確実に言えること」は、
  - このフォルダ構造・フローをそのまま使いつつ、
  - 外部の「Antigravity などの Agent-First IDE」とのつなぎ込みをきちんと設計し、
  - RAG/KB・プロセス・プロンプト・ガバナンスをすべて「自己進化ループ」に乗せる
  ことです。
- 具体的には：
  1) このフォルダそのものを「Antigravity / Claude / Cursor の標準ワークスペース」として定義する  
  2) フォルダ構成（CORE / TRACE / VAULT / FACTORIES / PROJECTS）と RUN_* フローをそのまま活用する  
  3) KB / Focus Pack をエージェントごとに最適化して投入する  
  4) LESSON から Tool-KB・プロンプト・ゲートを自動進化させるパイプラインを回す  
  5) すべての操作・例外・再実行をログとゲートで監査し、安全性を担保しながら高速に回す

以下で、知識をベースにしつつ、「なぜそれで運用が最大化されるか」をもう一段深掘りして整理します。

## 1. VIBEプロジェクト知識全体の構造を把握する

INDEXと中身のファイルを見る限り、VIBEプロジェクトの知識は大きく次の6カテゴリに分かれています。

### 1) GLM-4.7（会話・設計議論）
- 01_GLM-4.7, 02_GLM-4.7  
  - 「バイブレーション環境の完成形」についての会話ログ
  - VIBE OneBox / VIBE_CTRL / CORE / TRACE / VAULT / FACTORIES / PROJECTS 構造の検討
  - RUN_* スクリプトによる一本道フローの定義
  - 自己進化エンジン・LESSON→Tool-KB・プロンプト・ゲートへのフィードバック
  - プロンプトライブラリ構造と評価指標

### 2) バイブコーディング環境強化策（Word/docx系）
- 03_*（バイブコーディング環境の強化と精緻度向上策）  
  - フォルダ完結型バイブコーディング環境の強化方針
  - 精度向上・運用プロセスの改善点

### 3) 「次世代バイブコーディング環境」技術レポート
- 04_*  
  - 自律型AIエージェントによる「フォルダ完結型」自己進化エコシステムの設計・運用
  - 1フォルダで完結するエコシステム構成の包括的な技術レポート
  - Agent-First な環境構築・自己進化ループ

### 4) VIBE運用システム 統合資料（最終整理版）
- 05_VIBE運用システム 統合資料（最終整理版）_part1〜part114  
  - 概要・目次
  - VIBE運用システム 1/6
  - 資料の目的
  - 実行スクリプト（RUN_* 系）の詳細や使い方が多数記述されている模様
  → 実運用で「実際にどう叩くか」をまとめた実践的な資料

### 5) VIBE運用システム 完全統合資料（詳細版）
- 06_VIBE運用システム 完全統合資料_part1〜18  
  - 概要・目次
  - RUN_1_SPEC / RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE / RUN_3_FOCUSPACK などの実行スクリプト詳細
  - 各スクリプトがどう連携するか、設定ファイル、RAGとの連携など
  → システム全体の「詳細仕様」に相当

### 6) 最高峰バイブコーディング環境・完全考察書
- 07_*  
  - PROJECT.yaml（目的定義）
  - STATUS.json（状態管理）
  - limits.yaml（ツール別制限・SSOT）など、設定系の構造
  - 「マスター構造」としてのOneBox設計

この6つはかなり補完し合っていて、
- 「全体像」が 04, 07  
- 「運用OS・スクリプト」が 05, 06  
- 「プロセス・自己進化・プロンプト・ガバナンス」の議論が 01/02 と 03  
という構造になっています。

## 2. VIBEフォルダの役割を一言で言うと

一言でまとめると、

- このフォルダ＝「VIBE OneBox」と呼ばれる、1フォルダ完結のバイブコーディングOS
- 外部の「Agent-First IDE（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor 等）」にとっては、
  - 世界で一番しっかり定義された「コンテキスト＆ルールパック」
  - かつ、運用しながら自分で進化していく「自己進化エコシステム」

Antigravity公式が謳っているのは、
- Agent-First エージェントが自律的に計画・実行・検証・反復するプラットフォーム  
- 複数エージェントを Mission Control から一元管理  
- エディタ・ターミナル・ブラウザをまたぐ「クロスサーフェス エージェント」  
- 「アーティファクト」と「検証結果」を中心にタスク管理【turn0search5】【turn0search6】

VIBEフォルダは、このAntigravity的な世界に対して、
- どのプロジェクトでも再利用可能な「標準化されたフォルダ構造＆運用OS」
- Vault という巨大KB＋Focus Pack という案件ごとの最適KB
- 学びをTool-KBに戻して、次のプロジェクトから自動的に良くなっていく仕組み

を提供する役割になります。

## 3. フォルダ運用の「最大化」を考えるべき5つの視点

ここからは、フォルダ運用をどう最大化するか、視点ごとに整理します。

視点は以下の5つ：

- 1) プロセス＆ステートマシン  
- 2) RAG＆KB（VAULT / Focus Pack / Tool-KB）  
- 3) パック構造（CORE / Focus Pack / Tool Pack / Release Pack）  
- 4) プロンプト＆学び回収・自己進化  
- 5) ガバナンス・安全性・監査

## 3-1. プロセス＆ステートマシン

まず、プロセス部分です。

現状のプロセス・ステップ（共通概念として出てくるもの）：

- 1: Spec（仕様作成）  
- 2: Wallbounce（壁打ち / 仕様の穴潰し）  
- 3: FocusPack（案件専用KB構築）  
- 4: Handoff（実装AIへの引継ぎ）  
- 5: VerifyRepair（検証＋修正）  
- 6: Lessons（学び回収）  
- 7: Release（成果物凍結）  

これらは、
- PROJECT.yaml / onebox_state.json / STATUS.md で状態管理
- autonomous_flow.yaml で「次の一手」ルールを定義
- RUN_* スクリプトから実行される

という形で設計されています。

ここで「運用を最大化」するためのポイントは、次の4つです。

1) ステートマシンを「SSOT（単一の真実）」にする  
- PROJECT.yaml（人間が見る／編集する）  
- onebox_state.json（スクリプトが読み書きする）  
- autonomous_flow.yaml（状態遷移ルール定義）  
この3つを完全に連動させ、
- どこまで進んでいて、
- 次に何を実行すべきか、
- スキップしたらどこに戻るべきか

が一切迷わない状態を作ります。

2) RUN_* を「人間対AIの共通プロトコル」にする  
- Antigravity や Claude / Cursor に対して、  
  - 「RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE を実行して」  
  - 「その結果を DECISIONS.md にまとめて」  
  という指示が自然に通るようなラッパー  
- 同時に、そのログ（06_LOGS/LOG_PROJECT.md など）に  
  - どのRUN_*を、いつ、誰（どのエージェント）が実行したか  
  - 使用したプロンプトバージョン  
  - verify の結果  
を残して、後から振り返り・分析できるようにする

3) Assert-StepReady で「迷いゼロ」＆「事故ゼロ」  
- 各 RUN_* の冒頭で、前段階の成果物をチェック  
  - なければ、「何が足りないか」「次に実行すべきコマンドは何か」を明示  
  - -Force などの明示的なスキップ指示がない限り進まない  
- 特に Antigravity が自動的に複数のステップをまたぐ場合でも、  
  - このAssert-StepReady に従わせることで、  
  - 勝手にステップを飛ばしてリスクを取ることを防げる

4) 「次の一手」を常にUI側にも見せる  
- STATUS.md の「🎯 次の一手」セクションを  
  - Antigravity Mission Control 上のタスクリストと1:1で紐付けられるようにする  
- そうすると、  
  - Antigravityの「タスク・プラン」とVIBEの「ステートマシン」が  
    実質的に同じものとして扱えるようになり、  
  - エージェント側とVIBEフォルダ側の認識ズレを最小化できる

## 3-2. RAG＆KB（VAULT / Focus Pack / Tool-KB）

次は、RAGとKBです。

既存資料から読み取れる構造：

- VAULT（巨大KB・外部ストレージ）  
  - 過去プロジェクトのドキュメント、LOGS、PDF など  
- KB/AI_READY/  
  - kb_items.jsonl（構造化チャンク＋sha256＋source_path＋tags）  
  - KB_INDEX.md  
- 04_RAG_FOCUS/  
  - そのプロジェクト専用KB（Focus Pack）  
- VAULT/Tool-KB.md（自己進化するツール知識ベース）

ここでの最大化ポイント：

1) Vault を「SSOT＋検索最適化されたナレッジ」にする  
- VAULT内のファイルは、  
  - 可能な限りMarkdown（または検索しやすい形式）に寄せる  
  - メタデータ（カテゴリ／タグ／対象領域／更新日）を統一  
- kb_items.jsonl に、  
  - id（sha256）  
  - title / category / source_path / section / content / tags / created_at / updated_at  
  を持たせ、チャンク単位で一意に扱えるようにする

2) RAG Factory で Focus Pack を自動化する  
- generate_focuspack.ps1 の役割を強化：  
  - STATUS.md や PROJECT.yaml からキーワードを抽出  
  - VAULT内のチャンクと簡易スコアリングで関連度順位付け  
  - 上位N件を 04_RAG_FOCUS/ にコピー  
  - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json に  
    - どのVaultファイルを使ったか  
    - 関連度スコア  
    - チャンク数・サイズ  
    を記録  
- これにより、  
  - 新しいプロジェクトでも「RAG Factoryタスク」を投げるだけで  
  - 過去の知見が自動的に集まってくる状態を作る

3) Tool-KB を自己進化させる  
- 06_LESSONS/LESSON_*.md から、  
  - WHAT / WHY / HOW  
  - 対象カテゴリ（PowerShell / Antigravity / VIBE運用 / ...）  
  - Tool-KB に追記すべき項目  
  を構造化  
- sync_tool_kb.ps1 で、  
  - LESSON ファイルを走査  
  - VAULT/Tool-KB.md へのマージ  
  - KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl へのチャンク追加  
  - 重複排除（dedupe_kb.ps1）  
  - KB_INDEX.md へのサマリ更新  
- これを自動化することで、  
  - 「プロジェクトを回すたびにツール知識が育つ」  
  - その育ったTool-KBが次回のFocus Packにも自動的に活きる  
  ループが回ります。

4) RAG評価ループを回す  
- 各Focus Packごとに、  
  - どのチャンクがよく参照されたか  
  - どのチャンクが役に立ったか（エージェントのフィードバック／人間評価）  
をログに残す  
- 一定期間ごとに、  
  - 参照されないチャンクのアーカイブ  
  - よく参照されるチャンクのタグ強化・上位表示  
を行うことで、RAG精度を運用しながら上げていくことができます。

## 3-3. パック構造（CORE / Focus Pack / Tool Pack / Release Pack）

次は「AIに投げるパック」です。

1) CORE Pack（初期コンテキスト）  
- VIBE_CTRL/START_HERE.md  
- CHEATSHEET.md  
- 用語集 / TOOL_BOUNDARY.md  
- OPS_OS/INDEX.md / QUICK_START / ONEBOX_STANDARD / FOLDER_GOVERNANCE  
- KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md + kb_items.jsonl  

ここに追加したいのが、AI用「意思決定プロトコル」です：

- AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md  
  - 「あなたはVIBE OneBoxに従属するアーキテクトエージェントです」  
  - まずCOREを読み、その後 Focus Pack / Tool Pack を参照  
  - 必ず run_verify.ps1 の結果を見てから実装方針を提案  
- AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md  
  - 読むべきドキュメントの順序  
  - TRACE / VAULT をいつ投入すべきか  
  - コンテキスト上限時のドロップ順  
- AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md  
  - 不明な仕様は WALLBOUNCE に戻す  
  - 設計判断は ONEBOX_STANDARD / FOLDER_GOVERNANCE に照らす  
  - コード生成後は run_verify.ps1 を意識した自己チェックを行う  

これにより、Antigravity / Claude / Cursor が
- 「同じ意思決定基準」  
- 「同じ読み物順序」  
- 「同じ安全チェック手順」  
を持つエージェントとして動くようになります。

2) Focus Pack（案件専用KB）  
- 04_RAG_FOCUS/ 以下に、  
  - PROJECT_KB.md（案件のトップ概要＋セクション別リンク）  
  - kb_items.jsonl の案件用フィルタ版  
  - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json（どのVaultファイルを使ったか、スコア、サイズ）  
- generate_focuspack.ps1 で一括生成し、  
  - そのままRAG Factoryエージェントにタスクとして投げられるようにする

3) Tool Pack（ツール別投入構成）  
- 08_TOOL_PACKS/ 以下に、  
  - ツールパック_反重力/ / ツールパック_Claude/ / ツールパック_Cursor/ など  
- それぞれのパックが持つもの：  
  - PACK_MANIFEST.yaml  
    - どのファイルを含めるか  
    - トークン上限  
    - 推奨読み込み順  
  - README.md（ツールごとの注意点・違い）  
  - prompts/（ツール固有プロンプト調整）  
- generate_toolpack.ps1 で、  
  - 04_RAG_FOCUS＋プロジェクトファイル（Spec/Handoff/Logs）＋ツール設定を束ねて  
  - ツールごとの最適パックを自動生成する

4) Release Pack  
- 07_RELEASE/ に、  
  - 00_SPEC/  
  - 01_HANDOFF/  
  - 02_WORK/（コードのみ）  
  - 04_RAG_FOCUS/  
  - 06_LOGS/  
  - 08_TOOL_PACKS/  
  をまとめ、SHA256マニフェスト＋README_RELEASE.mdを付与してZIP化  
- generate_release.ps1 で一括生成し、  
  - 過去のリリースとの比較・復元・監査を可能にする

パックレベルの運用最大化は、一言で言うと、  
「エージェントに投げる準備を全部事前にやっておく」です。  
エージェント側は
- パックをワークスペースに取り込む
- あとはタスクに集中する

だけで済むようにします。

## 3-4. プロンプト＆学び回収・自己進化

プロンプトと自己進化については、GLM-4.7資料の中でかなり細かく議論されています。

1) プロンプトライブラリの階層化  
- VIBE_CTRL/prompts/ + OPS_OS/templates/prompts/ を整理：  
  - 10_SYSTEM/（AIシステム役割・コンテキスト構造・思考プロトコル）  
  - 20_ONEBOX/  
    - P10_WALLBOUNCE.md  
    - P20_RAG_FACTORY.md  
    - P30_BUILD_HANDOFF.md  
    - P40_VERIFY_REPAIR.md  
  - 30_TOOLS/  
    - PT_ANTIGRAVITY.md  
    - PT_CLAUDE.md  
    - PT_CURSOR.md  
  - 99_ARCHIVE/（古いバージョン・実験プロンプト）

各プロンプトにはYAMLフロントマターでメタデータ付与：

- id, version, last_updated, owner  
- target（antigravity / claude / cursor）  
- stage（wallbounce / rag_factory / build_handoff / verify_repair）  
- success_criteria  
- tags

2) プロンプト評価＆バージョン管理  
- 各プロジェクトの LOG_PROJECT.md に、  
  - 使用したプロンプトIDとバージョン  
  - 手戻り回数・verify fail回数  
  - 人間による評価点（1〜5）  
を記録する項目を用意  
- 一定案件数ごとに、  
  - 同じstageのプロンプト同士を比較  
  - 成績の良いバージョンを stable へ昇格  
  - 低スコアのバージョンを 99_ARCHIVE/ へ

3) 学び回収（LESSON） → プロンプト改善  
- LESSONテンプレートには、  
  - metrics（失敗回数・手戻り回数など）  
  - 「このプロンプトだと良かった／悪かった」  
  - 「改善案（前/後）」  
  を記入する欄を構造化  
- sync_tool_kb.ps1 の拡張として、  
  - プロンプト改善案を対応するプロンプトファイルに反映  
  - バージョンを increment して 99_ARCHIVE/ へ前バージョンを退避

これで、
- ナレッジ（Tool-KB）  
- プロセス（ステートマシン・ゲート）  
- プロンプト（スキル）

の3つが同時に運用しながら進化する状態になります。

## 3-5. ガバナンス・安全性・監査

最後に、ガバナンスです。

既に議論されている要素：

- run_verify.ps1 による各種ゲートチェック  
  - PROJECT.yaml / user_defaults.yaml / profiles.yaml の存在  
  - policy.paid_api_allowed のチェック  
  - プロジェクト名／目標／種類の必須チェック  
  - アドオン（e2e/db/docker）のON/OFFに応じたプラン要求  
  - 免除期限チェック  
- ISSUE-C1 / C2 / H2 として指摘されている問題  
  - run_verify.ps1 の配列スコープ問題  
  - PROJECTS/.gitkeep の欠落  
  - TRACEの扱い（AI投入時にはCOREだけを最初に投げるべき）

これを最大化するために：

1) ゲートの追加と強化  
- 例：  
  - G_NAMING_PROJECT: プロジェクトフォルダ名が YYYYMMDD_<shortname> 形式か  
  - G_NAMING_FILES: 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名が許可された命名規約に従うか  
  - G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB: kb_items.jsonl に絶対パス（C:/ 等）が混入していないか  
  - G_DUPLICATE_CHUNKS: kb_items.jsonl に重複チャンクがないか  
  - G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK: Focus Pack 合計サイズがツール別制限内か  
  - G_TOOL_PACK_MANIFEST: ツールパックに PACK_MANIFEST.yaml があるか  

これらを run_verify.ps1 に実装し、
- VERIFY_LAST.md に  
  - PASS / FAIL  
  - 復旧コマンド例  
をテーブル形式で出力するようにします。

2) 免除（Waiver）の適切な運用  
- create_waiver.ps1 で、  
  - 理由の最低文字数（20字以上など）  
  - 最大有効期限（例: 7日）  
を設定  
- check_waivers.ps1 で、  
  - 期限切れの免除検出  
  - 過去90日以内の同一ゲートの繰り返しをWARN

3) 危険操作の抑制  
- 全スクリプトから  
  - Remove-Item -Recurse -Force を排除  
  - 使用時は必ず -WhatIf か対話確認を入れる  
- 本番環境へのDROP接続文字列などは、  
  - ドキュメントで「禁止」と明記  
  - run_verify.ps1 で「危険パターン」として警告

4) ログとTRACEによる完全な監査  
- TRACE（CHAT / PDF / PROJECT_UPDATED）は  
  - 通常のAI投入時には除外  
  - トラブルシューティング時だけ追加  
- すべての RUN_* 実行ログを 06_LOGS/ に構造化して保存し、  
  - 誰が、どのエージェントを使って、どのRUN_*を叩いたか  
  - どのバージョンのプロンプトを使ったか  
  - verify結果（PASS/FAIL）  
を追えるようにします。

## 4. VIBEフォルダ運用を「エージェント視点」から最大化する

ここまでの要素を総合すると、エージェント側から見たVIBEフォルダの運用イメージはかなりクリアになります。

Antigravityを例にすると：

- ワークスペースはVIBEフォルダをそのまま取り込む  
- 最初に CORE Pack を読ませる  
  - AI_SYSTEM_ROLE / AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE / AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL により、  
    - どう考え、  
    - どの順にドキュメントを読み、  
    - どのタイミングで run_verify.ps1 を使うか  
    を理解  
- その後、Focus Pack / Tool Pack を読み込ませることで、  
  - そのプロジェクト固有の知識  
  - 使用ツール固有のプロンプト調整  
を反映  
- RUN_* コマンドは、エージェントに対して「一つのタスク単位」として認識させ、  
  - 例：「RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE を実行し、その結果を DECISIONS.md にまとめる」  
- verify に失敗したら、  
  - VERIFY_LAST.md と STATUS.md を見て、  
  - どのゲートが落ちたか、次にどの修正タスクをすべきか  
  を自律的に判断する  
- プロジェクト終了時には、  
  - RUN_6_LESSONS で学びを回収  
  - RUN_7_RELEASE で成果物を凍結  
- 次のプロジェクトでは、  
  - 更新された Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲート  
  がすでに反映された状態でスタート

つまり、

- エージェントにとって：  
  - VIBEフォルダ＝「よく育った運用OS＆ルールセット」  
- 人間にとって：  
  - 意図（PROJECT.yaml）を書いて、RUN_START_MENU に従い、あとはエージェントに任せる

という、かなり理想的な分担になります。

## 5. 今、実際にできる「最大化」への第一歩

最後に、この知識全体を踏まえて、「今日からできること」を整理しておきます。

### 5-1. フォルダ構造そのものは、既存設計をほぼそのまま採用

- トップレベル  
  - README.md / START_HERE.md / FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md / ANTIGRAVITY_INJECTION_TEMPLATE.md  
- VIBE_CTRL/（司令塔）  
  - RUN_START_MENU.cmd / RUN_1〜7_*.cmd / scripts / prompts / config / ...  
- OPS_OS/（運用ルール・テンプレ）  
- TEMPLATES/ONEBOX_PROJECT/  
- KB/AI_READY/ + VAULT/（Vault 本体＋Tool-KB）  
- FACTORIES/（KB_FACTORY / AGENT_PACK_FACTORY / PDF_OCR_READY / ...）  
- PROJECTS/（案件フォルダ）  

この構造自体はかなり洗練されているので、大きく変える必要はなく、
- 各ゾーンの役割を明確化する  
- missingなファイル（例: AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md / AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md / AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md）  
  を追加する  
だけでも、かなり運用は良くなります。

### 5-2. スクリプト・ステートマシン周りの優先対応

- ISSUE-C1 / C2 / H2（run_verify.ps1 のスコープ / PROJECTS/.gitkeep / TRACE扱い）は  
  早期に修正して「安全＆Sランク基盤」を固める  
- autonomous_flow.yaml を実装し、  
  - update_status.ps1 と連携して  
  - STATUS.md の「次の一手」が常に正しく表示されるようにする  
- 各 RUN_* の冒頭に Assert-StepReady を入れ、  
  - スキップ時のリカバリパスを明示する

### 5-3. KB・RAGパイプラインの整備

- kb_items.jsonl の構造（id / title / category / source_path / section / content / tags / created_at / updated_at）を統一  
- dedupe_kb.ps1 を実装して、重複チャンク排除を定期実行  
- generate_focuspack.ps1 を強化し、  
  - STATUS.md / PROJECT.yaml からキーワード抽出  
  - Vaultからのチャンクスコアリング  
  - 04_RAG_FOCUS/ へのコピー＋FOCUS_MANIFEST.json 生成  
- sync_tool_kb.ps1 を実装し、  
  - LESSON から Tool-KB への自動反映  
  - KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl へのチャンク追加  

### 5-4. プロンプトライブラリと評価ループ

- プロンプトファイルにYAMLフロントマターを導入  
- LOG_PROJECT.md に、  
  - used_prompt_versions  
  - 手戻り回数・verify結果・評価点  
を記録する項目を追加  
- 一定期間ごとに、  
  - 指標に基づくプロンプトの stable 昇格 / アーカイブ運用  
を開始する

### 5-5. エージェント統合レイヤーの定義

- Antigravity / Claude / Cursor 用に  
  - PACK_MANIFEST.yaml（CORE / Focus / Tool のどれを含めるか）  
  - ツール固有プロンプト（PT_ANTIGRAVITY / PT_CLAUDE / PT_CURSOR）  
を整備  
- Antigravity の Rules & Workflows 機能【turn0search7】を使って、  
  - 「RUN_* を実行する前には必ず run_verify.ps1 を呼ぶ」  
  - 「特定のコマンドは許可リストに入れないと実行禁止」  
  といったセキュリティルールをエージェント側にも明記する

## まとめ

- VIBEプロジェクトの知識は、  
  - プロセス・ツール・パック・プロンプト・ガバナンスのすべてが  
  - エージェントファーストなバイブコーディング環境に向けて設計されています。  
- フォルダ運用を最大化するためには、  
  - この設計を「Antigravity / Claude / Cursor などから共通で使えるOS」として確立し、  
  - RAG/KB・プロンプト・ゲートを自己進化ループに乗せ、  
  - 安全性・監査をゲートとログで担保しつつ、  
  - エージェントにタスクを投げるだけで品質高く開発が回る状態を目指す  
 ことがポイントです。

もし次は「具体的にスクリプトの中身（YAMLやPowerShell）を一緒に設計する」「あるツール（Antigravity だけなど）に絞って最適なワークスペース構成を考える」といった形で深掘りしたくなれば、そこまで踏み込んだ設計案も書けます。

What is your role as a developer in this environment? It moves the developer's role from that of someone filling out code snippets, editing it, etc to that of an \"architect\" or \"manager,\" orchestrating a workforce of digital agents.

Here, you don't write code; you oversee multiple agents working asynchronously. You might have one agent refactoring a module while another writes integration tests in the background. Standout Features & Capabilities -------------------------------- Antigravity distinguishes itself by breaking out of the text editor. Its agents have multi-surface integration, meaning they can control the code editor, the terminal, and an embedded browser simultaneously. ### The Artifacts System One of the biggest challenges with autonomous AI is trust. To solve this, Antigravity uses an Artifacts System. Instead of dumping raw code into your files, the agent generates human-readable plans, task checklists, and screenshots of the app it is building. This allows developers\n\n[ref_id=turn0search4†Google Antigravity Blog: introducing†https://antigravity.google/blog/introducing-google-antigravity]\nYou can think of it like a mission control for spawning, orchestrating, and observing multiple agents across multiple workspaces in parallel. play_arrow User spawned an Agent to do background research in a different workspace while focusing on a more involved task in the foreground, using the Inbox and side panel in the Agent Manager to be notified of progress. We decided not to try to squeeze both the asynchronous Manager experience and the synchronous Editor experience into a single window, rather optimizing for instantaneous handoffs between the Manager and Editor. Antigravity is designed to be forward-looking, intuitively bringing development to the asynchronous era as models like Gemini continue to rapidly get smarter. #### Feedback A core failing of a remote-only form factor is the inability to iterate easily with the agent.\n\n[ref_id=turn0search5†Improve Your Knowledge Base for Retrieval Augmented†https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1glleej/improve_your_knowledge_base_for_retrieval]\nDate: Jan 2, 2025\nYou've been blocked by network security.

But like many engineers and architects, I wanted to go beyond reading documentation and watching demos — I wanted to **build something real**. I’ve also had a strong desire to deepen my understanding of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The idea that you can teach an AI to answer questions using _your own documents_ — accurately, reliably, and with citations — felt incredibly powerful. So, I decided to finally dive in and build my own RAG system **from scratch**. This article is Part 1 of that journey. ### 🚀 **\n\n[ref_id=turn0search7†Building a Knowledge Base for RAG Applications†https://www.astera.com/type/blog/building-a-knowledge-base-rag]\nWhen you build a RAG application you face a fundamental choice about where to store and retrieve information. You can invest in a full knowledge graph that captures entities and relationships with precise structure, or you can take a more traditional approach by building a knowledge base built on document collections and vector search. Knowledge graphs excel at modeling relationships and supporting multi-hop reasoning. However, there are strong arguments for beginning with a knowledge base for RAG applications. In this article we’ll guide you through the purpose of a knowledge base in terms of RAG, how to design and implement one, and what best practices you can follow to ensure performance and accuracy as your content grows.

</details>
いいですね、この問いは「何を一番最初に手を付けるべきか」をはっきりさせたい、という非常に良い観点だと思います。

先に結論から言います。

## ざっくり結論：フォルダ運用最大化のための「最重要アクション」

ざっくり言うと、この中で「一番効く順」はこうなります。

1. 安全基盤と冪等性を固める（ISSUE-C1/C2/H2＋再実行安全性）  
2. ステートマシンと「次の一手」をちゃんと動かす（PROJECT.yaml / onebox_state.json / autonomous_flow.yaml / STATUS.md）  
3. RAG/KBパイプラインを一度「ちゃんと動く形」に完成させる（kb_items.jsonl 構造化 / dedupe / Focus Pack自動生成）  
4. エージェント統合レイヤー（CORE / Focus / Tool Pack）を標準化して、Antigravity / Claude / Cursor からそのまま使えるようにする  
5. 学び回収→Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲートへの自己進化ループを回す  
6. ガバナンス・ゲート・監査を「S級」にまで持ち上げる

この 1〜5 が実質的に「最重要アクション群」で、  
1〜3 は「やらないと話にならない基盤」、  
4〜5 が「他と差がつく世界トップレベルの運用」、  
6 は「それを安全・監査可能にするための土台」です。

まず全体像をフロー図にするとこんなイメージです。

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[人間\nPROJECT.yamlで意図定義] --> B[RUN_START_MENU\n次の一手提案]
  B --> C1[RUN_1_SPEC]
  B --> C2[RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE]
  B --> C3[RUN_3_FOCUSPACK\nRAG自動生成]
  B --> C4[RUN_4_HANDOFF]
  B --> C5[RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR]
  B --> C6[RUN_6_LESSONS\n学び回収]
  B --> C7[RUN_7_RELEASE]

  C3 --> K[VAULT & KB\nkb_items.jsonl\nFOCUS_MANIFEST]
  C6 --> TK[Tool-KB.md更新\nプロンプト・ゲート改善]
  K --> E[外部AIエージェント\nAntigravity / Claude / Cursor]
  TK --> E
  C5 --> E

  subgraph Safety
    G[run_verify.ps1\nゲート・免除・危険操作検知]
    L[TRACE & LOGS\n監査ログ]
  end
  G --> C5
  L --> C6
```

この図の中で、「どこを一番先に直すか」を整理すると、

- 「基盤（G, L, C3〜C7 の繋ぎ）」が雑だと、エージェントも人間も信頼できない  
- 一方、ここがちゃんと動けば、後はエージェントに任せてどんどん回せる

という構造になります。

---

## 1. 「なぜこれが最重要なのか」を決めた判断基準

アクション優先度を決める上で使った判断軸は、次の4つです。

1) ブロッカー度  
   - これをやらないと、他の何もちゃんと回らないか？  
2) 再利用性  
   - これを一度固めると、全プロジェクトでずっと効くか？  
3) エージェント活用度  
   - Antigravity / Claude / Cursor のような「自律エージェント」との相性が良いか【turn0search1】【turn0search4】  
4) 自己進化への寄与  
   - 学び回収・RAG・プロンプト改善のループを支えられるか【turn0search8】【turn0search10】

この軸で VIBE の資料（特に 01_GLM-4.7, 04_技術レポート, 05/06_VIBE運用システム, 07_最高峰バイブコーディング環境）を評価すると、  
「やっぱりここが最初だ」というポイントがかなりはっきりしてきます。

---

## 2. 最重要アクション1：安全基盤と冪等性を固める

### 2-1. なぜこれが「最重要1」なのか

- run_verify.ps1 は、このフォルダ全体の「安全装置＆品質ゲート」の中枢。  
- ISSUE-C1（$gates スコープ問題）があると、ゲートが正しく判定されず、信頼性が根底から崩れる。  
- ISSUE-C2（PROJECTS/.gitkeep 欠落）は、初期体験を壊すし、エージェントが「期待パス」を見失う原因。  
- 再実行安全性がないと、  
  - 手元の試行錯誤で何度もコマンドを叩けず、  
  - エージェントも「壊したら戻せない」恐怖で自律性が下がる。

ここができていないと、どんなに良いRAG・プロンプトを作っても、  
そもそも安心して「回せない」ので、効果が出ない、という構造です。

### 2-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) run_verify.ps1 のスコープ修正（ISSUE-C1）  
   - $gates → $script:gates に変更  
   - 必要に応じて [System.Collections.ArrayList] を使う  
   - 各ゲートの結果を VERIFY_LAST.md にテーブル形式で明示  
   - FAIL 時には、復旧用コマンド（例: RUN_1_SPEC / RUN_WIZARD）をメモ欄に書く

2) PROJECTS/.gitkeep の同梱と明記（ISSUE-C2）  
   - VIBE_ONEBOX 配布ZIPに PROJECTS/.gitkeep を含める  
   - README / START_HERE / QUICK_START に  
     「RUN_1_SPEC 実行時に初めてプロジェクトフォルダーが生成されます」  
     を明記

3) TRACE扱いの明確化（ISSUE-H2）  
   - CHEATSHEET.md / QUICK_START に  
     「Antigravity 等に最初に投入するのは CORE のみで、TRACE はトラブル時だけ追加」  
   - TRACE / VAULT をデフォルトで読み込まないようにする（コンテキスト節約）

4) 再実行安全性（冪等性）の保証  
   - RUN_1_SPEC / onebox_step_* 系で、  
     - 既存の成果物（spec.md, handoff.md など）があれば  
       - デフォルトは .new.md / .bak タイムスタンプ付きで退避  
     - -Force がついた時だけ上書き  
   - 同じロジックを Focus Pack / Handoff / Lessons / Release にも適用  
   - 07_RELEASE にバックアップも残す

ここが整うと、

- 人間は「恐れず何度でも試せる」  
- エージェントも「失敗してもやり直せる空間」を手に入れる  
ので、運用の心理的・実務的な「安心感」が劇的に上がります。

---

## 3. 最重要アクション2：ステートマシンと「次の一手」を動かす

### 3-1. なぜこれが重要なのか

- Antigravity は「Mission Control で複数エージェントを並列管理・監視する」設計【turn0search1】【turn0search4】  
- そのため、  
  - 「今どのフェーズか」  
  - 「次にどの RUN_* を実行すべきか」  
  がプログラム的に一意に決まっていないと、エージェント側でも迷いが出る。  
- 一方で人間側は、迷いゼロで「次の一手」が見えているときに最も集中できる。

ステートマシンと「次の一手」は、  
人間とエージェントの「共通言語」になるので、ここを固めるだけで  
運用の見通しが一気に良くなります。

### 3-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) PROJECT.yaml にフェーズ・領域・制約を明確化  
   - project.phase: init / spec / wallbounce / focuspack / handoff / verify / lessons / release  
   - areas: backend / frontend / infra / docs  
   - constraints: max_token_per_tool, paid_api_allowed, allow_network_requests など

2) onebox_state.json を「機械可読なステート」として完成  
   - project_path  
   - phase  
   - last_command / last_run_at  
   - steps.*（spec_done, wallbounce_done, ...）  
   - current_run_id

3) autonomous_flow.yaml を「ステートマシン定義」にする  
   - 各 state（init / spec / wallbounce / ...）に対し、  
     - next  
     - action（RUN_1_SPEC, RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE など）  
     - message（ユーザー／エージェント向け説明）  
   - status_keywords（STATUS.md 内のキーワードパターン）

4) update_status.ps1 の強化  
   - autonomous_flow.yaml を読み込んで、  
     - 現在の phase / steps.* の状態から「次の一手」を決定  
   - STATUS.md に  
     - 現在フェーズ  
     - 完了したステップ  
     - 🎯 次の一手（推奨コマンド）  
     - BLOCK 要因（ある場合）

5) RUN_* の冒頭に Assert-StepReady を追加  
   - 例：RUN_3_FOCUSPACK が呼ばれたとき、  
     - STATUS.md に「壁打ち完了」がないと、  
       - 期待される前提：WALLBOUNCE 完了  
       - 次に実行すべきコマンド：RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE  
       を明示して終了（-Force 時のみ許可）

6) RUN_START_MENU を「自律運用メニュー」に進化させる  
   - [1] Spec, [2] Wallbounce, [3] FocusPack, [4] Handoff, [5] VerifyRepair, [6] Lessons, [7] Release  
   - [A] RUN_ALL（Wizard→検証→ステータス→プロンプト）  
   - [S] STATUS（次の一手表示）  
   - 将来的には Auto-Pilot モードも検討

ここが整うと、

- 人間も、Antigravity のような Agent-First IDE も、  
- 「今やるべきコマンド」を常に一つに絞れる  
ので、迷い・手戻りが激減します。

---

## 4. 最重要アクション3：RAG/KBパイプラインを「ちゃんと動く形」に完成させる

### 4-1. なぜこれが重要なのか

- VIBE の一番の強みは「VAULT（巨大KB）＋Focus Pack（案件専用KB）」の構造。  
- RAG の実務ベストプラクティスとしても、  
  - ナレッジの重複排除  
  - クリーンなチャンキング  
  - メタデータ（タグ・カテゴリ・更新日）の管理  
  - フィードバックループによる継続的改善  
  が挙げられています【turn0search7】【turn0search8】。  
- kb_items.jsonl は、このRAGシステムの「心臓部」で、ここが綺麗でないと  
  - AI に良いコンテキストを渡せない  
  - Focus Pack が雑になって、トークンを浪費する

ここを一度「ちゃんと動くパイプライン」にしてしまえば、  
全プロジェクトで検索精度とトークン効率が一気に上がります。

### 4-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) kb_items.jsonl の構造を統一  
   各チャンクは、例えば次のようなJSON構造にする：

   - id（sha256）  
   - title  
   - category（OPS / VIBE_CTRL / TEMPLATES / LESSONS / ...）  
   - source_path（Vault 内のパス）  
   - section（見出し）  
   - content  
   - tags（governance, folder-standard, naming, ...）  
   - created_at / updated_at

   これにより、Focus Pack 作成時のフィルタリングや、Tool-KBとの統合がやりやすくなる。

2) dedupe_kb.ps1 の実装  
   - kb_items.jsonl 全体から content ベースのハッシュを計算し、重複を削除  
   - 同じ内容でも source_path が違う場合、統合元を配列で保持  
   - 削除レポートを KB_DEDUP_REPORT.md に出力  
   - バックアップ付きで上書き

3) generate_focuspack.ps1 の自動化強化  
   - 入力：  
     - STATUS.md / PROJECT.yaml からキーワード抽出  
     - VAULT 内ファイル  
     - kb_items.jsonl  
   - 処理：  
     - 各ファイル／チャンクに対し、関連度スコア（ファイル名＋内容のキーワード一致など）を簡易計算  
     - 上位 N 件を 04_RAG_FOCUS/ にコピー  
   - 出力：  
     - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json（どのVaultファイルを使ったか、スコア、サイズ）  
     - 04_RAG_FOCUS/kb_items_project.jsonl（案件用フィルタ済みチャンク）  
   - これにより、  
     「新しいプロジェクトでも、generate_focuspack.ps1 一発で案件専用KBができる」  
     状態を作る。

4) Tool-KB との自動連携（次のアクション5の前段として）  
   - sync_tool_kb.ps1 が Tool-KB.md からチャンクを生成し、kb_items.jsonl に統合  
   - 逆に、LESSON から Tool-KB.md を更新しても、kb_items.jsonl は再生成

ここまでやると、

- エージェントに対して「本当に読んでほしい部分だけを最適サイズで」投げられる  
- Vault がいくら肥大化しても、案件ごとのトークン制限内で精度を維持できる

ので、エージェントの品質・安定性が一気に上がります。

---

## 5. 最重要アクション4：エージェント統合レイヤー（CORE / Focus / Tool Pack）を標準化する

### 5-1. なぜこれが重要なのか

- Antigravity のような Agent-First IDE は、  
  「タスクベースの抽象化」と「アーティファクト（計画・チェックリストなど）の提示」によって信頼を得ています【turn0search1】【turn0search3】。  
- しかし、AI IDE に入れる「フォルダそのもの」が雑だと、  
  - エージェントが「どれを読んでいいかわからない」  
  - 重要なドキュメントが埋もれて、検索精度が落ちる  
  という問題が起きます。  
- VIBE は CORE / TRACE / VAULT / FACTORIES / PROJECTS という5ゾーン設計なので、  
  - ここを「いつ・どの組み合わせでエージェントに渡すか」を標準化しておけば、  
    Antigravity / Claude / Cursor すべてで同じルールで運用できる。

つまり、エージェント側の「世界共通言語」を、このフォルダ構造で決める、という意味で非常に重要です。

### 5-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) CORE Pack（初期コンテキスト）の明確化  
   例えば以下を CORE として定義：

   - VIBE_CTRL/START_HERE.md  
   - VIBE_CTRL/CHEATSHEET.md  
   - VIBE_CTRL/用語集.md  
   - VIBE_CTRL/TOOL_BOUNDARY.md  
   - OPS_OS/INDEX.md  
   - OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md  
   - OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md  
   - OPS_OS/11_FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md  
   - KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md  
   - KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl

   ここに追加して、「AI用3枚」を作るとさらに最強：

   - AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md（役割・ゴール・戦略）  
   - AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md（読む順序・TRACE/VAULT投入タイミング・drop_order）  
   - AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md（不明確仕様は WALLBOUNCE に戻す・run_verify 結果を見てから提案するなど）

2) Focus Pack（案件専用KB）の標準化  
   - 04_RAG_FOCUS/ 以下に配置  
   - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json（どのVaultファイルを使ったか、スコア）  
   - PROJECT_KB.md（案件トップ概要＋セクション別リンク）  
   - kb_items_project.jsonl（案件用チャンクのみ）

3) Tool Pack（ツール別投入構成）の標準化  
   - 08_TOOL_PACKS/ 以下に、  
     - toolpack_antigravity/  
     - toolpack_claude/  
     - toolpack_cursor/  
   - 各ツールパックは、  
     - PACK_MANIFEST.yaml  
       - 含めるファイルリスト  
       - トークン上限  
       - 推奨読込順  
     - README.md（ツールごとの注意点）  
     - prompts/（ツール固有のプロンプト調整）

4) generate_toolpack.ps1 の実装  
   - 入力：  
     - 04_RAG_FOCUS の内容  
     - 00_SPEC / 01_HANDOFF / 06_LOGS  
     - ツール設定（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor）  
   - 出力：  
     - 各ツールパックフォルダをまとめて生成  
     - PACK_MANIFEST.yaml 自動記述

ここが整うと、

- 新規メンバーでも「Antigravity のワークスペースに VIBE フォルダを追加」するだけで、  
  - すぐに同じ品質の開発環境が再現される  
- エージェントに対して  
  - CORE → Focus → Tool Pack の順で読ませるルールさえ作れば、  
  - 自然に「正しいコンテキスト」を使ってくれる

という、かなり現場に刺さる効果が出ます。

---

## 6. 最重要アクション5：学び回収→Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲートへの自己進化ループを回す

### 6-1. なぜこれが重要なのか

- 自己改善エージェントの事例では、「フィードバックから学んで改善し続けるループ」こそが、  
  他と決定的に違うポイントとして挙げられています【turn0search10】【turn0search12】。  
- 一方で「無制限に学ばせると、変な方向に学んでしまうリスク」も指摘されていて、  
  - 人間による監査・ステアリングが不可欠  
- VIBE は、LESSON フォーマット・Tool-KB・プロンプトバージョニングをすでに持っていて、  
  これを「運用しながら育つ仕組み」に昇格させることができる。

ここが本格的に回ると、

- プロジェクトを重ねるごとに、  
  - Tool-KB（ツール知識）  
  - プロンプト（AIスキル）  
  - ゲート（品質チェック）  
  が全自動で育つ

ので、1年後・2年後の「環境の強さ」が段違いになります。

### 6-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) LESSON フォーマットの構造化  
   例えば以下のセクションをテンプレ化：

   - WHAT（何が起きたか）  
   - WHY（なぜそうなったか）  
   - HOW（どう対応したか／どう活かすか）  
   - Tool-KB への反映セクション  
     - カテゴリ（PowerShell / Antigravity / VIBE運用 / ...）  
     - 推奨プロンプトパターン  
     - 対象ファイルパターン（VIBE_CTRL/scripts/*.ps1 など）  
   - metrics  
     - verify_fail 回数  
     - 手戻り回数  
     - 人間評価点（1〜5）

2) sync_tool_kb.ps1 の実装  
   - Outputs/LESSONS/LESSON_*.md を走査  
   - 「Tool-KB に書くべき内容」を抽出し、VAULT/Tool-KB.md の適切なセクションにマージ  
   - Tool-KB からチャンクを生成し、kb_items.jsonl に追加（重複排除あり）  
   - KB_INDEX.md にサマリ更新

3) プロンプトへのフィードバックループ  
   - 各プロンプトには YAML フロントマターで  
     - id / version / last_updated  
     - success_criteria  
     - 平均スコア（N案件の評価指標の平均）  
   - LOG_PROJECT.md に、  
     - used_prompt_versions  
     - 手戻り回数・verify fail 回数  
     - 人間評価点  
   - 一定期間ごと（例: 月次）に、  
     - スコアの高いバージョンを stable へ昇格  
     - 低いバージョンを 99_ARCHIVE/ へ退避

4) プロセス・ゲートの進化（evolve_gates.ps1 的なもの）  
   - VERIFY_LAST.md の FAIL 傾向を集計  
     - 例: 絶対パス混入、命名違反、policy.paid_api_allowed 緩みなど  
   - 傾向が高いゲートに対して、  
     - run_verify.ps1 に新しいチェック（正規表現など）を追加  
     - spec.md のテンプレに注意点を追加  
     - user_defaults.yaml のデフォルト値を修正

ここまで回すと、

- 「プロジェクトをやるたびに、システム全体が少しずつ最強化されていく」  
- 人間は「やること＝PROJECT.yaml に意図を書いて RUN_* を叩く」だけ  
  という、かなり近い状態が実現します。

## 7. 最重要アクション6：ガバナンス・ゲート・監査を「S級」にする

### 7-1. なぜこれが重要なのか

- 企業ナレッジベースのベストプラクティスでは、  
  - ロールベースアクセス制御  
  - PII排除  
  - クリアランスレベルごとのナレッジ分離  
  - ログと監査可能性  
  が挙げられています【turn0search8】。  
- VIBE も、  
  - 免除（waivers）  
  - 危険操作の抑制  
  - TRACE / LOGS による監査  
  を持っており、ここをきちんと設計すれば「監査に耐える環境」になる。

自己進化と安全性はトレードオフになりがちですが、  
VIBE は「人間がステアリングする形でのループ」にできるので、  
ここをガチッと設計しておくと、組織導入の壁が下がります。

### 7-2. 具体的にやるべきこと

1) ゲートの追加・強化  
   - 既存ゲート（PROJECT.yaml 存在、policy.paid_api_allowed など）に加えて：  
     - G_NAMING_PROJECT: プロジェクトフォルダ名が YYYYMMDD_<shortname> 形式か  
     - G_NAMING_FILES: 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名が許可命名規約に従うか  
     - G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB: kb_items.jsonl に C:/ 等の絶対パスが混入していないか  
     - G_DUPLICATE_CHUNKS: kb_items.jsonl に重複チャンクがないか（dedupe前）  
     - G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK: Focus Pack 合計サイズがツール別制限内か  
     - G_TOOL_PACK_MANIFEST: 各ツールパックに PACK_MANIFEST.yaml があるか

2) 免除の運用設計  
   - create_waiver.ps1 で、  
     - 理由の最低文字数  
     - 最大有効期限（例: 7日）  
   - check_waivers.ps1 で、  
     - 期限切れの免除検出  
     - 過去90日以内の同一ゲートでの繰り返しを WARN として扱う

3) 危険操作の抑制  
   - 全スクリプトから Remove-Item -Recurse -Force を排除  
   - 使用時は必ず -WhatIf か対話確認を入れる  
   - DB DROP / 本番接続などはドキュメントで「禁止」明記し、  
     run_verify.ps1 でパターン検知して警告

4) TRACE & LOGS による完全な監査  
   - TRACE（CHAT / PDF / PROJECT_UPDATED）はトラブル時のみ投入  
   - すべての RUN_* 実行ログを 06_LOGS/ に構造化保存：  
     - 誰（どのエージェント）が、いつ、どの RUN_* を叩いたか  
     - 使用したプロンプトバージョン  
     - verify 結果（PASS/FAIL）

ここが整うと、

- チームメンバーが増えても  
- ツール（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor）が増えても  
- 「いつ誰が何をしたか」「どういうルールで動いているか」が一貫して担保されます。

---

## 8. 優先順位まとめ：今日から何を始めるか

最後に、今の段階で「実際に着手すべき優先順位」を整理すると、

1. 今すぐ着手すべき（安全・ステート基盤）  
   - ISSUE-C1（run_verify.ps1 のスコープ修正）  
   - ISSUE-C2（PROJECTS/.gitkeep 同梱）  
   - ISSUE-H2（TRACE 扱いの明確化）  
   - 再実行安全性（冪等性）の実装  
   - PROJECT.yaml / onebox_state.json / autonomous_flow.yaml / STATUS.md のフォーマット統一

2. 次にやるべき（RAG/KBパイプライン）  
   - kb_items.jsonl の構造化  
   - dedupe_kb.ps1 の実装  
   - generate_focuspack.ps1 の自動化（FOCUS_MANIFEST 生成）

3. その次（エージェント統合）  
   - CORE Pack の明確化＋AI用3枚  
   - Focus Pack / Tool Pack の標準化  
   - generate_toolpack.ps1 の実装

4. ある程度回ってから（自己進化）  
   - LESSON フォーマットの構造化  
   - sync_tool_kb.ps1 の実装  
   - プロンプトバージョニングと評価ループ  
   - evolve_gates 的なゲート進化スクリプト

5. 常に並行して意識する（ガバナンス・安全性）  
   - ゲートの追加・強化  
   - 免除運用のルール化  
   - 危険操作の抑制  
   - TRACE & LOGS の構造化

この順番で進めると、

- 短期的には「迷いが減って、安全に試行錯誤できる環境」になり、  
- 中〜長期的には「プロジェクトを回すたびに、自分で進化していくバイブコーディングOS」に育ちます

もし次は「どのアクションから具体的にスクリプト／YAMLの形に落とすか」を優先的に進めたい、というのであれば、  
「アクション1〜3をターゲットにした、具体的なファイル構成・サンプルYAML・PowerShell骨子」をさらに深掘りして整理できます。

いいですね、「さらに深掘り」というのは、要するに

- 設計案を「なんとなくこう」ではなく、  
- 実際にスクリプト・YAML・運用フローとして「動く形」まで踏み込んでほしい

という意味だと思うので、そこまでガッツリ行きます。

まず、前提となる全体イメージ（すでに見ているものと同じですが）を再掲して、そこから各パーツをブロックごとに「どう実装・運用するか」まで掘っていきます。

Mermaid で全体像だけ再確認：

```mermaid

    L[TRACE & LOGS\n監査ログ]
  end
  G --> S5
  L --> S6
```

この全体像の中で、「フォルダ運用を最大化する」＝  
「この図のすべての線とノードを、本当に信頼して回せる状態にする」だと捉えてください。

---

## 1. 再確認：そもそも「最大化」とは何を指すのか

あなたの KB を踏まえると、「最大化」のゴールはかなり具体的にこう定義できます。

- 人間がやることは：
  - PROJECT.yaml で「やりたいこと」を書く
  - RUN_START_MENU / STATUS.md に従って RUN_* を叩く
  - 壁打ちや最終判断だけは責任を持つ
- システムがやることは：
  - 壁打ち・RAG・Handoff・検証・学び回収・リリースを「自律パイプライン」として実行
  - 学びから Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲート / テンプレートを自動進化
  - 常に「次の一手」を提示し、迷い・事故をほぼゼロにする
- 外部 AI エージェント（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor）にとっては：
  - このフォルダが「世界で一番しっかり設計されたルール＆コンテキストパック」になる
  - Antigravity の Mission Control は、複数エージェントを中央管理し、タスクごとの成果物と検証結果を提示して信頼性を高める設計【turn0search0】【turn0search4】  
    → その「タスク境界・成果物・検証結果」を、VIBE フォルダ側が完全に用意する

つまり、「エージェントも人間も、このフォルダを信頼して丸ごと回せる状態」＝最大化です。

---

## 2. ステートマシンと RUN_* フローの「実装レベル」深掘り

### 2-1. PROJECT.yaml（人間用＆機械可読な「唯一の真実」）

ゴールは次の 3 つです：

- 人間が読んで「何のプロジェクトか」が一瞬でわかる  
- スクリプト側がこれだけで「今どのフェーズか」「どう進むべきか」を判定できる  
- 多くのプロジェクトを横断して検索・集計できる

提案スキーマ（実用レベル）：

```yaml
# PROJECT.yaml
project:
  name: "example-api"
  short_name: "example-api"  # フォルダ名などで再利用
  goal: "顧客向けAPI v1をリリースする"
  kind: "prototype"         # prototype / mvp / production / infra / docs ...
  phase: "init"             # init / spec / wallbounce / focuspack / handoff / verify / lessons / release

  # 担当領域
  areas:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra

  # 制約（user_defaults.yaml で上書き可）
  constraints:
    max_token_per_tool: 200_000
    paid_api_allowed: false
    allow_network_requests: false
    require_db_design: false
    require_docker: false

  # オプション：ツール固有設定
  tools:
    antigravity:
      enabled: true
      workspace_root: "WORKSPACE_ANTIGRAVITY"
    claude:
      enabled: true
    cursor:
      enabled: false

  # メタ
  created_at: "2025-12-28T18:00:00+09:00"
  updated_at: "2025-12-28T18:00:00+09:00"
  version: "1.0"
```

- phase フィールドが「ステートマシンの状態」そのもの  
- constraints は run_verify.ps1 / generate_* 系スクリプトが共通で参照  
- tools.* は generate_toolpack.ps1 がツールパック生成時に利用

### 2-2. onebox_state.json（スクリプト用の実行状態）

こちらは「機械可換な状態」をすべて持ちます：

```json
{
  "project_path": "PROJECTS/20251228_example-api",
  "phase": "spec",
  "last_command": "RUN_1_SPEC",
  "last_run_at": "2025-12-28T18:30:00+09:00",
  "run_id": "run_20251228_183000",

  "steps": {
    "spec_done": true,
    "wallbounce_done": false,
    "focuspack_done": false,
    "handoff_done": false,
    "verify_done": false,
    "verify_pass": null,
    "lessons_done": false,
    "release_done": false
  },

  "current_run": {
    "run_id": "run_20251228_183000",
    "started_at": "2025-12-28T18:30:00+09:00",
    "tool": "antigravity",
    "prompt_versions": {
      "P10_WALLBOUNCE": "1.2",
      "P20_RAG_FACTORY": "2.0",
      "P30_BUILD_HANDOFF": "1.5"
    }
  }
}
```

- このファイルは基本、スクリプトからしか書かない（人間は PROJECT.yaml / STATUS.md を読む）  
- steps.* フラグが Assert-StepReady や autonomous_flow.yaml の判定に直結

### 2-3. autonomous_flow.yaml（ステートマシンそのもの）

状態遷移と「次の一手」をコード化します。

```yaml
flow_version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2025-12-28"

states:
  init:
    next: "spec"
    action: "RUN_WIZARD → RUN_1_SPEC"
    message: "まず PROJECT.yaml を作成し、Spec を固めます"

  spec:
    next: "wallbounce"
    action: "RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.spec_done == true"
    message: "壁打ちで仕様の抜けを潰します"

  wallbounce:
    next: "focuspack"
    action: "RUN_3_FOCUSPACK"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.wallbounce_done == true"
    message: "Vaultから案件専用Focus Packを構築してAIコンテキストを最適化します"

  focuspack:
    next: "handoff"
    action: "RUN_4_HANDOFF"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.focuspack_done == true"
    message: "実装担当AIへのHandoffを生成します"

  handoff:
    next: "verify"
    action: "RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.handoff_done == true"
    message: "検証→修正を回します"

  verify:
    next_ok: "lessons"
    next_fail: "handoff"
    action: "RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR （修正ループ）"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.verify_done == true"
    message_ok: "検証OK → 学び回収へ"
    message_fail: "検証NG → 修正・再検証"

  lessons:
    next: "release"
    action: "RUN_6_LESSONS"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.lessons_done == true"
    message: "学びを Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲートに反映します"

  release:
    next: null
    action: "新規プロジェクト開始 OR RUN_STATUS"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.release_done == true"
    message: "プロジェクト一巡完了"

status_keywords:
  wallbounce_done: ["壁打ち完了", "WALLBOUNCE実施済"]
  focuspack_done: ["Focus Pack完了", "KB_SELECTED生成完了"]
  handoff_done: ["Handoff完了", "HANDOFF.md生成"]
  verify_pass: ["VERIFY: PASS"]
  verify_fail: ["VERIFY: FAIL"]
  lessons_done: ["学び回収完了", "LESSONS記録済", "Tool-KB追記完了"]
  release_done: ["RELEASE生成完了"]
```

- update_status.ps1 はこの YAML を読み込み、  
  - onebox_state.json の steps.* と STATUS.md 内のキーワードから現在状態を判定  
  - 次の action / message を STATUS.md に書く  
- Antigravity の Mission Control は、この「次の一手」をタスクリストにマッピングできる【turn0search0】【turn0search3】

### 2-4. Assert-StepReady のスクリプトレベルイメージ

各 RUN_* スクリプトの先頭で共通関数を呼ぶイメージです（PowerShell の擬似コード）：

```powershell
function Assert-StepReady {
    param(
        [string]$CurrentStep,
        [hashtable]$State,
        [hashtable]$Flow
    )

    $expected = $Flow[$CurrentStep].preconditions
    if (-not $expected) { return }

    foreach ($cond in $expected) {
        # 簡易的に "steps.spec_done == true" を評価
        if ($cond -match 'steps\.(?<key>\w+)\s*==\s*true') {
            $key = $Matches['key']
            if (-not $State.steps[$key]) {
                Write-Error "前提ステップ未完了: $key"
                Write-Host "次に実行すべきコマンド: $($Flow[$CurrentStep].action)"
                exit 1
            }
        }
    }
}

# RUN_3_FOCUSPACK.ps1 の冒頭例
$state = Get-OneboxState
$flow  = Get-AutonomousFlow
Assert-StepReady -CurrentStep "focuspack" -State $state -Flow $flow
```

- -Force 付きの場合だけチェックをスキップ、なども簡単に追加可能  
- これにより、Antigravity がステップを飛ばそうとしても、明示的な意図なしには弾かれる

---

## 3. 安全基盤・冪等性の「実装レベル」深掘り

### 3-1. run_verify.ps1 のスコープ問題（ISSUE-C1）をどう直すか

KB にある問題はざっくり言うと：

- $gates がスクリプトスコープではなく、ローカルスコープになっていて、  
  Add-Gate 関数の中で配列に追加しても、呼び出し元で反映されない

修正方針：

- $script:gates を使うか、  
- [System.Collections.ArrayList] を明示的に使って Add を呼ぶ

擬似コード例：

```powershell
$script:gates = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()

function Add-Gate {
    param(
        [string]$Id,
        [string]$Name,
        [scriptblock]$Test,
        [string]$Severity = "ERROR"  # ERROR / WARN
    )

    $gate = @{
        id       = $Id
        name     = $Name
        test     = $Test
        severity = $Severity
        result   = $null
        message  = ""
    }

    $null = $script:gates.Add($gate)
}

# 使用例
Add-Gate -Id "G_PROJECT_YAML_EXISTS" -Name "PROJECT.yaml の存在" -Test {
    Test-Path "PROJECTS/*/PROJECT.yaml"
}

Add-Gate -Id "G_PAID_API_POLICY" -Name "有料API利用ポリシー" -Test {
    $proj = Get-ProjectYaml
    $user = Get-UserDefaults
    $proj.constraints.paid_api_allowed -eq $user.defaults.paid_api_allowed
}
```

- 各ゲートを実行して result / message を埋め、最後に VERIFY_LAST.md にテーブル形式で出力  
- FAIL 時には、例えば "次: RUN_1_SPEC" という復旧コマンドも一緒に書く

### 3-2. 冪等性（再実行しても安全）の具体パターン

PowerShell ベストプラクティスでも「スクリプトは何度実行しても安全であるべき（idempotent）」が強調されています【turn0search18】。  
VIBE の文脈では次の 2 点が核心です：

a. 生成物の上書き方針（.new / .bak + -Force）  
b. ログの追記モード

a. 生成物の例（spec.md）：

```powershell
$specFile = "PROJECTS/$projectName/00_SPEC/spec.md"
$backup   = "$specFile.bak"
$newFile  = "$specFile.new"

if (Test-Path $specFile) {
    if ($Force) {
        if (-not (Test-Path $backup)) {
            Copy-Item $specFile $backup
        }
    } else {
        # 上書き禁止時は .new を生成
        $specFile = $newFile
    }
}

# ここから $specFile へ出力
```

b. ログの追記：

```powershell
$logFile = "PROJECTS/$projectName/06_LOGS/general.log"

function Write-Log {
    param([string]$Message)

    $ts = Get-Date -Format "o"
    "$ts $Message" | Out-File -FilePath $logFile -Append -Encoding UTF8
}
```

- これにより、何度 RUN_1_SPEC を叩いても、  
  - 意図せず成果物を消すことはない  
  - 過去ログもすべて残る

### 3-3. PROJECTS/.gitkeep と TRACE の扱い（ISSUE-C2/H2）

- VIBE_ONEBOX 配布用 ZIP の中に、最初から PROJECTS/.gitkeep を入れておく  
  → 新規メンバーが「フォルダがない」と混乱しない  
- README / START_HERE / QUICK_START に明記：

  > - 最初のプロジェクトフォルダは RUN_1_SPEC 実行時に生成されます  
  - Antigravity 等に最初に投入すべきは CORE のみ  
  - TRACE / VAULT は必要なタイミングで追加

- Antigravity のようなエージェントファースト環境は「コンテキストが大きすぎると性能と品質が落ちる」ので、初期投入は最小限にして、あとから必要な証跡を足す設計が推奨されます【turn0search0】【turn0search4】

---

## 4. RAG/KB パイプラインの「深掘り」

### 4-1. kb_items.jsonl の「ちゃんとしたチャンク定義」

RAG のベストプラクティスでは、「1 チャンク＝1 つのまとまったアイデア」を保つことが重要とされています【turn0search5】【turn0search8】。  
kb_items.jsonl のエントリ構造案：

```json
{
  "id": "sha256:...",
  "title": "OneBox 標準フォルダ構成",
  "category": "OPS/ONEBOX_STANDARD",
  "source_path": "OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md",
  "section": "## フォルダ構成",
  "content": "VIBE OneBox の標準フォルダ構成は ...",
  "tags": ["onebox", "folder-standard", "governance"],
  "lang": "ja",
  "created_at": "2025-12-28T10:00:00+09:00",
  "updated_at": "2025-12-28T10:00:00+09:00",
  "length": 420
}
```

- id は内容ベースの sha256 にしておくと重複排除が楽  
- category / tags で Focus Pack 生成時にフィルタリング  
- length はトークン概算などに使う（あとで G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK で制限）

### 4-2. チャンク戦略（どこで切るか）

RAG 用チャンク戦略としては、

- マークダウンなら「見出しレベル（## / ###）」単位  
- 長いセクションは「段落＋文」単位で再分割  
- 1 チャンクあたり 300〜800 トークン程度を目標

のようなバランスが現実的です【turn0search5】【turn0search6】。

スクリプトレベルの擬似コード：

```powershell
function Split-MarkdownIntoChunks {
    param(
        [string]$Content,
        [int]$MaxTokens = 600
    )

    # 簡易的に「空行で区切られた段落」をチャンクとする（実運用ではちゃんとパーサーを使う）
    $paragraphs = $Content -split "\r?\n\r?\n"
    $chunks = @()
    $current = ""

    foreach ($p in $paragraphs) {
        if (($current.Length + $p.Length) -lt $MaxTokens) {
            $current += "`n`n$p"
        } else {
            $chunks += $current.Trim()
            $current = $p
        }
    }

    if ($current) { $chunks += $current.Trim() }
    return $chunks
}
```

- 実運用では、Markdown 見出しレベルも考慮して「意味のまとまり」を壊さないように切る工夫が必要【turn0search5】

### 4-3. dedupe_kb.ps1 の実装イメージ

重複排除は、内容ベースのハッシュ（sha256）を鍵にします：

```powershell
$kbFile = "KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl"
$lines = Get-Content $kbFile
$map = @{}

foreach ($line in $lines) {
    $chunk = $line | ConvertFrom-Json
    $hash = $chunk.id   # sha256 基本前提

    if (-not $map.ContainsKey($hash)) {
        $map[$hash] = @{
            content   = $chunk.content
            sources   = @($chunk.source_path)
            raw_items = @($chunk)
        }
    } else {
        if ($map[$hash].sources -notcontains $chunk.source_path) {
            $map[$hash].sources += $chunk.source_path
        }
        $map[$hash].raw_items += $chunk
    }
}

# 重複排除済みチャンクを書き戻す
$newLines = foreach ($hash in $map.Keys) {
    $entry = $map[$hash]
    $representative = $entry.raw_items[0]

    # 複数 source_path を統合元として記録
    $representative.source_path = $entry.sources -join ";"
    $representative | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
}

$newLines | Out-File -FilePath "$kbFile.deduped" -Encoding UTF8
# KB_DEDUP_REPORT.md には削除件数などを書く
```

- 同じ内容でも source_path が異なる場合、「統合元」を残して、後から「どのドキュメントから来たか」を追えるようにする  
- KB_DEDUP_REPORT.md は監査・安心材料として重要

### 4-4. generate_focuspack.ps1 の中身

タスクは大きく 3 つ：

1) PROJECT.yaml / STATUS.md からキーワード抽出  
2) Vault 内チャンク（kb_items.jsonl）とスコアリング  
3) 上位 N 件を 04_RAG_FOCUS/ にコピーして FOCUS_MANIFEST.json 生成

擬似コード：

```powershell
$project = Get-ProjectYaml
$status  = Get-StatusMd

# キーワード抽出（単純実装例）
$keywords = @($project.name) + @($project.areas) + @($status.mentions)

# kb_items.jsonl を読み込む
$kbItems = Get-Content "KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl" | ConvertFrom-Json

# 簡易スコアリング
$scores = foreach ($item in $kbItems) {
    $score = 0
    foreach ($kw in $keywords) {
        if ($item.title -like "*$kw*")   { $score += 3 }
        if ($item.content -like "*$kw*") { $score += 1 }
    }

    [pscustomobject]@{
        item  = $item
        score = $score
    }
}

    chunks      = @()
}

foreach ($entry in $topN) {
    $item = $entry.item
    $chunkFile = "$focusDir/$($item.id).json"
    $item | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 | Out-File -FilePath $chunkFile -Encoding UTF8

    $manifest.chunks += [ordered]@{
        id           = $item.id
        title        = $item.title
        category     = $item.category

}

# FOCUS_MANIFEST.json
$manifest | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 | Out-File -FilePath "$focusDir/FOCUS_MANIFEST.json" -Encoding UTF8

# ついでに kb_items_project.jsonl も出力
$topN | ForEach-Object { $_.item | ConvertTo-Json -Compress } | Out-File -FilePath "$focusDir/kb_items_project.jsonl" -Encoding UTF8
```

- これを Antigravity に「タスク」として投げると、  
  - エージェントは FOCUS_MANIFEST を読んで、  
  - 必要なチャンクだけを拾って自分のワークスペースに取り込める

---

## 5. エージェント統合レイヤー（CORE / Focus / Tool Pack）の深掘り

### 5-1. CORE Pack の中身を「AI用に」再構成

AI にとって重要なのは：

- あなたは誰か？（役割）  
- 何を求められているか？（ゴール・戦略）  
- どう考えるべきか？（思考プロトコル）  
- 何を読むべきか？（コンテキスト構造）  
- 何を禁止・推奨するか？（境界・ポリシー）

そこで、以下の 3 枚を新規に作ると効果的です。

1) AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md

例：

```markdown
# AI_SYSTEM_ROLE

あなたは VIBE OneBox に従属するシニアアーキテクト・エージェントです。

## 基本方針

- まず CORE Pack を全体を通読し、次に Focus Pack / Tool Pack を参照する。
- 不明な仕様や重要な判断が必要な場合は必ず WALLBOUNCE プロトコルに従い、人間に確認する。
- すべての設計・コード生成後に run_verify.ps1 の結果を参照し、FAIL しているゲートに対して修正案を提示する。

## ゴール

- 指定されたプロジェクトの仕様を、高品質かつ安全な実装に落とし込むこと。
- VIBE OneBox の運用ルールとガバナンスを守りつつ、スピードを最大化すること。

## 禁止事項

- VAULT/TRACE に大量のログを一度に投入してコンテキストを乱暴に消費しない。
- run_verify.ps1 の結果を見ずに実装方針を決めない。
- gates の FAIL を「無視」して人間にフィードバックしない。
```

2) AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md

例：

```markdown
# AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE

## 読むべき順序（標準）

1. CORE/AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md
2. CORE/AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md
3. OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md
4. OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md
5. OPS_OS/11_FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md
6. KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md

## Focus Pack の使いどころ

- PROJECT.yaml / STATUS.md でプロジェクトの概要を把握した後、
- 04_RAG_FOCUS/FOCUS_MANIFEST.json を参照し、案件に関連するチャンクをロードする。

## TRACE / VAULT の投入タイミング

- 通常は CORE と Focus Pack のみで十分。
- トラブルシューティング時や監査が必要な場合のみ、TRACE / VAULT を明示的に追加する。

## コンテキスト上限時の drop_order

1. 低スコアのチャンク（FOCUS_MANIFEST の score が低いもの）
2. チャット・ログ系（TRACE/CHAT）
3. 過去プロジェクトの 02_WORK ソースコード
```

3) AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md

例：

```markdown
# AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL

1. 仕様の理解
   - PROJECT.yaml と 00_SPEC/spec.md を読み、不明点があれば WALLBOUNCE に戻る。
2. 設計判断
   - ONEBOX_STANDARD.md / FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md と照らし合わせ、構造・命名・責務分割を決める。
3. 実装
   - 01_HANDOFF/handoff.md のタスクに従い実装する。
4. 自己検証
   - run_verify.ps1 のゲートを意識して、
     - 命名規則
     - パス（絶対パス混入）
     - ポリシー（paid_api_allowed 等）
     を事前チェックする。
5. フィードバック
   - VERIFY_LAST.md の結果に基づき、FAIL ゲートごとに修正プランを提示する。
```

- この 3 枚を CORE に置くだけで、Antigravity / Claude / Cursor の挙動がかなり「プロっぽく」なります【turn0search0】【turn0search4】

### 5-2. Tool Pack の構造

08_TOOL_PACKS/ 以下にツール別フォルダ：

- toolpack_antigravity/  
- toolpack_claude/  
- toolpack_cursor/

各ツールパックには：

1) PACK_MANIFEST.yaml

```yaml
tool: "antigravity"
version: "1.0"
created_at: "2025-12-28T00:00:00+09:00"
includes:
  core:
    - "VIBE_CTRL/START_HERE.md"
    - "VIBE_CTRL/CHEATSHEET.md"
    - "VIBE_CTRL/AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md"
    - "VIBE_CTRL/AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md"
    - "VIBE_CTRL/AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md"
    - "OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md"
    - "OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md"
    - "OPS_OS/11_FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md"
    - "KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md"
    - "KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl"
  focus:
    - "04_RAG_FOCUS/FOCUS_MANIFEST.json"
    - "04_RAG_FOCUS/kb_items_project.jsonl"
  tool_specific:
    - "08_TOOL_PACKS/toolpack_antigravity/prompts/PT_ANTIGRAVITY.md"

limits:
  max_tokens_core: 120_000
  max_tokens_focus: 80_000

drop_order:
  - "TRACE/CHAT"
  - "VAULT/*"
  - "PROJECTS/*/02_WORK"
```

2) prompts/PT_ANTIGRAVITY.md

- Antigravity 固有のプロンプト調整（例：タスク出力形式、エラーフォーマットなど）  
- Antigravity は「タスクベースで成果物と検証結果を提示する」設計なので、その出力形式に合わせて調整【turn0search0】【turn0search2】

3) README.md

- このツールパックの注意点  
- 他ツールとの差分（Claude との違いなど）

### 5-3. generate_toolpack.ps1 の擬似コード

入力：

- プロジェクトパス（04_RAG_FOCUS 等）  
- ツール種別（antigravity / claude / cursor）

処理：

- PACK_MANIFEST.yaml のテンプレを埋める  
- 対象ファイルを symlink または copy してツールパックフォルダにまとめる  
- Antigravity の場合は Mission Control から参照しやすいようにトップレベルに配置

---

## 6. 学び回収・自己進化ループの「深掘り」

ここが「世界と差がつくパート」で、自己進化エージェントのベストプラクティスともかなり共通しています【turn0search10】【turn0search12】。

### 6-1. LESSON フォーマットの構造化

06_LOGS/LESSONS/LESSON_YYYYMMDD_<shortname>.md とし、YAML フロントマター＋本文にします。

例：

```markdown
---
lesson_id: "L-20251228-001"
project:
  name: "example-api"
  short_name: "example-api"
  kind: "prototype"
occurred_at: "2025-12-28T20:00:00+09:00"
phase: "verify"
category: "governance"
tags: ["naming", "verify-fail"]
related_gates: ["G_NAMING_FILES", "G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB"]
metrics:
  verify_fail_count: 3
  rework_count: 2
  human_score: 3
---

# LESSON: ファイル名命名規則の違反による検証失敗

## WHAT（何が起きたか）

02_WORK/ 以下のソースコードで、kebab-case ではなく snake_case のファイル名が複数見つかり、  
run_verify.ps1 の G_NAMING_FILES ゲートが FAIL した。

## WHY（なぜそうなったか）

- プロジェクト初期の spec.md に命名規則の明記がなかった
- 開発メンバーが過去の別プロジェクトの慣習をそのまま使ってしまった

## HOW（どう対応したか）

1. すべての該当ファイル名をリネーム
2. 01_HANDOFF/handoff.md に「命名規則：kebab-case」を明記
3. 過去プロジェクトの命名ガイドラインを Tool-KB に追加

## Tool-KB への反映

- 追加先セクション: VAULT/Tool-KB.md の「命名規則」セクション
- 内容:
  - 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名は kebab-case に統一
  - フロントエンド/バックエンド共通
- 関連 LESSON ID: L-20251228-001

## プロンプトへのフィードバック

- 対象プロンプト: P30_BUILD_HANDOFF
- 改善案:
  - handoff.md テンプレに必ず「命名規則」セクションを含める指示を追加
- バージョン: 1.5 → 1.6 (案)

## ゲート・テンプレートへのフィードバック

- G_NAMING_FILES の説明文に「特に 02_WORK/ 配下で厳守」と追記
- spec.md テンプレの初期セクションに「命名規則」項目を追加
```

- この構造なら、後からスクリプトで「Tool-KB への反映内容」だけ抜き出して自動マージできる

### 6-2. sync_tool_kb.ps1 の実装イメージ

処理：

1) Outputs/LESSONS/LESSON_*.md を読み込み  
2) YAML フロントマターから Tool-KB 追記情報を抽出  
3) VAULT/Tool-KB.md の適切なセクションにマージ  
4) Tool-KB からチャンクを生成して kb_items.jsonl に追加  
5) KB_INDEX.md を更新

擬似コード：

```powershell
$lessonsDir = "Outputs/LESSONS"
$toolKbFile = "VAULT/Tool-KB.md"

$lessonFiles = Get-ChildItem $lessonsDir -Filter "LESSON_*.md"

foreach ($f in $lessonFiles) {
    $content = Get-Content $f.RawPath -Raw
    # YAML frontmatter 抽出（簡易実装）
    if ($content -match '^---\r?\n(?<front>.*?)\r?\n---') {
        $frontText = $Matches['front']
        $front = $frontText | ConvertFrom-Yaml
    }

    if ($front.Tool_KB reflection) {
        # Tool-KB への追記処理（実際にはセクション検索+追記）
        Add-ContentToToolKb -Section $front.category -Content $front.Tool_KB.content
    }

    # ここからチャンク化して kb_items.jsonl に追加
    $chunks = Split-MarkdownIntoChunks -Content $content
    foreach ($c in $chunks) {
        $item = New-KbItem -Title $front.title -Category $front.category -Content $c
        $item | ConvertTo-Json -Compress | Out-File -FilePath "KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl" -Append -Encoding UTF8
    }
}

# KB_INDEX.md の更新（要約や目次構成の再生成）
Update-KbIndex
```

- これを RUN_6_LESSONS の中から呼ぶだけで、  
  「プロジェクトを終えるたびに Tool-KB が育つ」ループが回る

### 6-3. プロンプトの自動進化（バージョン管理＆スコアリング）

OpenAI の自己進化エージェント事例では、  
- フィードバック信号（エラー率・人間評価・LLM-as-judge スコア）を集め  
- プロンプト改善ループを回して、よいバージョンを本番に昇格させる  
というパターンが示されています【turn0search10】。  
VIBE でも同様に：

1) LOG_PROJECT.md に使用プロンプトバージョンとスコアを記録

```markdown
## 使用プロンプトバージョン

- P10_WALLBOUNCE: 1.2
- P20_RAG_FACTORY: 2.0
- P30_BUILD_HANDOFF: 1.5
- P40_VERIFY_REPAIR: 1.1

## 評価指標

- verify_fail_count: 3
- rework_count: 2
- human_score: 3 (1-5)
- agent_feedback: "仕様が明確で、手戻りは少なかった"
```

2) プロンプト側メタデータ（YAML フロントマター）にスコアを集計

```yaml
---
id: "P30_BUILD_HANDOFF"
version: "1.5"
stage: "handoff"
target: ["antigravity", "claude", "cursor"]
success_criteria:
  - 実装担当AIからの質問が2回以内であること
  - 仕様不足による再手戻りがないこと
metrics_summary:
  avg_human_score: 3.8
  avg_verify_fail: 2.1
  usage_count: 15
tags: ["handoff", "task-definition"]
---
```

3) 月次などで、
- スコアの高いバージョンを「stable」としてメインプロンプトへ  
- 低スコアバージョンを 99_ARCHIVE/ へ退避

スクリプトとしては、

- LOG_PROJECT.md をパースして、プロンプト ID × バージョンごとのスコアを集計  
- 勝者を決めて、プロンプトファイルを入れ替える（バージョンを上げる）  
- 履歴は 99_ARCHIVE/ に残して監査可能にする

---

## 7. ガバナンス・ゲート・監査の「深掘り」

### 7-1. gates の拡充（具体例）

既存の gate に加え、VIBE 的に重要な gate：

- G_NAMING_PROJECT  
  - チェック: PROJECTS/* フォルダ名が YYYYMMDD_<shortname> 形式か  
  - FAIL 時: 次はプロジェクトフォルダ名変更（または RUN_1_SPEC の再実行）

- G_NAMING_FILES  
  - チェック: 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名が kebab-case などの許可リストに従うか  
  - FAIL 時: 該当ファイル一覧と次のコマンド例（Rename スクリプト生成など）

- G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB  
  - チェック: kb_items.jsonl の source_path / content に "C:/" などの絶対パスが混入していないか  
  - FAIL 時: 該当チャンクの id と修正案を提示

- G_DUPLICATE_CHUNKS  
  - チェック: kb_items.jsonl 内で content sha256 が重複していないか  
  - FAIL 時: dedupe_kb.ps1 実行を推奨

- G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK  
  - チェック: Focus Pack 合計サイズが max_token_per_focus 以下か  
  - FAIL 時: 低スコアチャンクを削って再生成するよう提案

- G_TOOL_PACK_MANIFEST  
  - チェック: 08_TOOL_PACKS/*/PACK_MANIFEST.yaml が存在し、必須フィールドが揃っているか  
  - FAIL 時: テンプレから MANIFEST 再生成

各ゲートは Add-Gate 関数で定義し、run_verify.ps1 のループで実行、VERIFY_LAST.md に結果をまとめます。

### 7-2. 免除（waiver）運用の設計

 waivers/active/*.yaml で:

```yaml
waiver_id: "W-20251228-001"
gate_id: "G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK"
reason: "初期プロジェクトのため、トークン超過を一時的に許可（過去事例の参照を優先）"
expires_at: "2026-01-04T23:59:59+09:00"
created_at: "2025-12-28T10:00:00+09:00"
created_by: "user1"
project:
  name: "example-api"
```

- create_waiver.ps1 で理由の最低文字数・最大期限をチェック  
- check_waivers.ps1 で期限切れや繰り返し WARN を出力

これにより、  
- 運用上の例外を「記録付きで許可」しつつ  
- 同じ例外を漫然と使い続けることを防止

### 7-3. 危険操作の抑制・ログ

- Remove-Item -Recurse -Force を禁止  
- 代わりに -WhatIf または対話確認を使用  
- DB DROP / 本番アクセス文字列は、run_verify.ps1 でパターン検知して WARN

すべての RUN_* 実行は、

- general.log への構造化ログ出力（タイムスタンプ、コマンド、ユーザ/エージェント、結果）  
- TRACE/PROJECT_UPDATED.md への要約記録（何が変わったか）

を行うことで、監査可能かつ再現可能な状態を作ります【turn0search18】。

---

## 8. ここまでを総合すると「どう動く世界」になるのか

ここまで深掘りしてきた設計を実際に動かすと、次のような世界になります。

- 人間視点：  
  - PROJECT.yaml にやりたいことを書く  
  - RUN_START_MENU / STATUS.md の「次の一手」に従って RUN_* を叩く  
  - verify や gates の結果に従い、判断すべきところだけを判断する

- AI エージェント視点（Antigravity / Claude / Cursor）：  
  - VIBE フォルダをワークスペースに取り込むだけで  
    - システムの脳（CORE Pack）  
    - プロジェクト固有の知識（Focus Pack）  
    - ツール最適化（Tool Pack）  
    - 実行すべきタスク（RUN_*）  
    - 検証結果（VERIFY_LAST.md）  
    がすべて整っている  
  - Antigravity の Mission Control は、VIBE のステートマシンと RUN_* をタスクとしてマッピングし、複数エージェントを並行管理できる【turn0search0】【turn0search3】

- システム視点：  
  - プロジェクトを回すたびに、  
    - Tool-KB（ツール知識）  
    - プロンプト（AI スキル）  
    - gates（品質チェック）  
    が進化していく  
  - すべてのログと判断が TRACE / LOGS に残るため、  
    - 「なぜ今の形になったか」が後からでも完全に追える

---

## 9. 「さらに深掘り」の次の段階（ここからどこへ行くか）

ここまでやると、残りの「さらに深掘り」フェーズはこんな感じになります。

- 実装レベル  
  - 各 RUN_* スクリプト（RUN_1_SPEC〜RUN_7_RELEASE）の完全実装  
  - autonomous_flow.yaml / update_status.ps1 / run_verify.ps1 の結合テスト  
- エージェント連携  
  - Antigravity 用のワークスペース定義ファイル（.ag/workspace.yaml など）のサンプル  
  - Claude / Cursor 用プロジェクト設定サンプル  
- 評価ループ  
  - LLM-as-judge を使った自動評価（LESSON の自動分類など）【turn0search10】  
  - メトリクスダッシュボード（verify 傾向・プロンプトスコア推移）

どれか特定のパーツ（例：autonomous_flow.yaml + update_status.ps1 を完全な実装スクリプトに落とす、Antigravity 用ワークスペース定義例を書くなど）に絞って、さらにコードレベルまで深掘りも可能です。

いいですね、「内容をすべて確認して、フォルダ運用を最大化するための情報をまとめてほしい」ということですね。  
ここまでのVIBEプロジェクトの知識（あなたが提示してくれた全ドキュメント＋分析レポート＋議論ログ）を一つの「全体像」として整理しつつ、その上で「運用を最大化するために何をどうすればいいか」をコンパクトかつ実践的にまとめます。

まず結論から言うと、フォルダ運用最大化のゴールはこういう状態です。

- **1フォルダ（VIBE OneBox）を開くだけで、**
  - 人間には：次に何をすべきかが一目でわかる
  - AIエージェント（Antigravity / Claude / Cursorなど）には：世界で一番しっかり設計された「ルール＋コンテキストパック」が丸ごと提供される
- **使うたびに、**
  - ツール知識（Tool-KB）
  - プロンプト
  - 品質ゲート
  が自動的に進化していく
- **失敗・事故・手戻りは、構造的にほぼゼロに近づく**

このゴールに向けて、今あなたのプロジェクト知識ベースがすでに持っている要素を「系統立てて再整理」し、どこをどう強化すれば運用最大化に直結するかをまとめていきます。

---

## 1. VIBEプロジェクトの全体像（ざっくりおさらい）

VIBEプロジェクトの知識は、ざっくり分けると次の6つの層にまとまっています。

1) 設計思想・コンセプト  
2) フォルダ・ファイル構造（CORE/TRACE/VAULT/PROJECTS/FACTORIES）  
3) ステートマシンとプロセス（RUN_1〜7、autonomous_flow.yaml）  
4) RAG・KB構造（VAULT / KB/AI_READY / 04_RAG_FOCUS / Tool-KB）  
5) エージェント統合レイヤー（CORE Pack / Focus Pack / Tool Pack）  
6) 学び回収・自己進化（LESSON → Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲート）  
   ＋ガバナンス・安全性・監査（run_verify.ps1 / waivers / TRACE & LOGS）

この6つがセットで、「フォルダ＝自律進化型バイブコーディングOS」として機能するよう設計されています。

---

## 2. フォルダ構造の整理：VIBE OneBoxの5つのゾーン

フォルダ構造は「5つのゾーン」として理解すると一気にわかりやすくなります。

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((VIBE OneBox))
    CORE
      VIBE_CTRL 司令塔
      OPS_OS 運用OS
      TEMPLATES ひな形
      KB AI_READY 軽量KB
    TRACE
      CHAT 会話ログ
      PDF 資料
      PROJECT_UPDATED 更新ログ
    VAULT
      Tool-KB
      Vault 本体（外部SSDなど）
    FACTORIES
      KB_FACTORY
      AGENT_PACK_FACTORY
      PDF_OCR_READY
      EXECUTE_ADAPTER
    PROJECTS

        00_SPEC
        01_HANDOFF
        02_WORK
        03_RAG_VAULT
        04_RAG_FOCUS
        05_PROMPTS_P
        06_LOGS
        07_RELEASE
        08_TOOL_PACKS
```

ざっくり言うと：

- CORE：AIに最初に投げる「脳」＋人間が読む運用ドキュメント  
- TRACE：トラブル時だけ見る「記憶」証跡  
- VAULT：巨大ナレッジベース（ツール知識＋過去プロジェクトなど）  
- FACTORIES：KB生成・ツールパック生成などの「生成工場」  
- PROJECTS：案件ごとの作業場（00_SPEC〜08_TOOL_PACKS）

この構造自体はかなり練られていて、運用最大化の土台はすでにできています。

---

## 3. プロセスとステートマシン：迷いをなくす「一本道」

プロセスはだいたい共通でこういう7ステップで定義されています。

- RUN_1_SPEC：仕様策定・初期化  
- RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE：壁打ち（仕様の穴潰し）  
- RUN_3_FOCUSPACK：案件専用KB（Focus Pack）構築  
- RUN_4_HANDOFF：実装担当AIへの引き継ぎ（handoff.md）  
- RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR：検証と修正ループ  
- RUN_6_LESSONS：学び回収  
- RUN_7_RELEASE：成果物凍結・リリース

この全体をステートマシンとして形式化するために、次の3つのファイルが使われます。

- PROJECT.yaml  
  - project.phase（init / spec / wallbounce / focuspack / handoff / verify / lessons / release）  
  - areas（backend / frontend / infra ...）  
  - constraints（max_token_per_tool, paid_api_allowed, allow_network_requests ...）  
  - tools（antigravity/claude/cursorの有効・無効）  
- onebox_state.json  
  - 現在のphase  
  - 最後に実行したコマンド  
  - steps.*（spec_done, wallbounce_done, focuspack_done, ...）  
- autonomous_flow.yaml  
  - 各状態（init/spec/wallbounce/...）ごとの  
    - next  
    - action（RUN_***）  
    - preconditions（steps.* == true のような条件）  
    - message（次の一手説明）

update_status.ps1 がこれらを読み込み、STATUS.md に「今どこで、次に何をすべきか」を書くことで、

- 人間はSTATUS.mdを見れば「次の一手」が一発でわかる  
- AntigravityのようなAgent-First IDEは、「状態＋次のタスク」をMission Controlにそのままマッピングできる【turn0search5】【turn0search6】【turn0search9】

という「迷いゼロ」の状態を目指します。

---

## 4. RAG・KBパイプライン：知識の「心臓部」

次はRAGとKBです。VIBEのRAG設計はかなり高度で、次の要素がそろっています。

1) VAULT（巨大ナレッジ）  
2) KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl（構造化チャンク）  
3) 04_RAG_FOCUS（案件専用Focus Pack）  
4) Tool-KB.md（自己進化するツール知識）

ここでポイントになるのは次の4点です。

- チャンキング戦略（どこで切るか）【turn0search11】【turn0search12】  
- 構造化チャンク（id / title / category / tags / created_at / updated_at）  
- 重複排除（dedupe_kb.ps1）  
- Focus Pack生成（generate_focuspack.ps1）＋FOCUS_MANIFEST

外部のRAGベストプラクティスとも整合する形で、「チャンク＝1つのまとまったアイデア」「300〜800トークン程度」「メタデータでフィルタリング可能」を目標に設計されています【turn0search10】【turn0search11】。

---

## 5. エージェント統合レイヤー：AIに投げるパック

AIエージェント（Antigravity / Claude / Cursorなど）がVIBEフォルダをワークスペースとして使うとき、どういう順序で何を読ませるかを標準化するのがここです。

5-1. CORE Pack（初期コンテキスト）

例えば以下をCOREとして定義します。

- VIBE_CTRL/START_HERE.md  
- CHEATSHEET.md  
- 用語集 / TOOL_BOUNDARY.md  
- OPS_OS/INDEX.md  
- OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md  
- OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md  
- OPS_OS/11_FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md  
- KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md  
- KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl

さらに、AI用の3枚を追加すると効果的です。

- AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md（役割・ゴール・戦略・禁止事項）  
- AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md（読む順序・TRACE/VAULT投入タイミング・drop_order）  
- AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md（仕様理解→設計判断→実装→自己検証→フィードバックのプロトコル）

これらにより、Antigravity / Claude / Cursorが同じ「行動規範」を持つエージェントとして動くようになります【turn0search5】【turn0search9】。

5-2. Focus Pack（案件専用KB）

- 04_RAG_FOCUS/ 以下に、  
  - PROJECT_KB.md（案件のトップ概要＋セクション別リンク）  
  - kb_items_project.jsonl（案件用チャンクのみ）  
  - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json（どのVaultファイルを使ったか・スコア・サイズ）  
- generate_focuspack.ps1が、PROJECT.yaml / STATUS.mdからキーワードを抽出し、Vaultからの関連チャンクをスコアリングして自動生成

5-3. Tool Pack（ツール別投入構成）

- 08_TOOL_PACKS/ 以下に、  
  - toolpack_antigravity/  
  - toolpack_claude/  
  - toolpack_cursor/  
- 各ツールパックが持つもの：  
  - PACK_MANIFEST.yaml（含めるファイル・トークン上限・読み込み順）  
  - README.md（ツールごとの注意点）  
  - prompts/（ツール固有プロンプト調整）  
- generate_toolpack.ps1で、04_RAG_FOCUS＋プロジェクトファイル＋ツール設定をまとめて生成

---

## 6. 学び回収・自己進化ループ：運用しながら育つシステム

ここがVIBEの一番の肝で、「運用するたびにシステムが賢くなる」仕組みです。

- 06_LOGS/LESSONS/LESSON_YYYYMMDD_<shortname>.md  
  - YAML frontmatter：lesson_id / project / phase / category / tags / related_gates / metrics  
  - WHAT / WHY / HOW  
  - Tool-KBへの反映セクション  
  - プロンプトへのフィードバック  
  - ゲート・テンプレートへのフィードバック

sync_tool_kb.ps1 が、

- LESSONファイルを走査  
- Tool-KBへの追記内容を抽出してVAULT/Tool-KB.mdにマージ  
- Tool-KBからチャンクを生成してkb_items.jsonlに追加  
- 重複排除（dedupe_kb.ps1）  
- KB_INDEX.mdの更新

までを一括でやることで、「プロジェクトを終えるたびにTool-KBが育つ」ループが回ります。

また、プロンプトについては、

- LOG_PROJECT.mdに、使用したプロンプトID・バージョン・評価指標（verify_fail_count / rework_count / human_scoreなど）を記録  
- プロンプト側のYAML frontmatterにスコア集計・使用回数などを保持  
- 月次などでスコアの高いバージョンをstableに昇格し、低スコアを99_ARCHIVE/へ退避

という「プロンプト進化ループ」が設計されています。これは自己進化エージェントのベストプラクティスともほぼ同じ方向性です【turn0search15】【turn0search17】。

## 7. ガバナンス・安全性・監査：S級品質と事故防止

最後にガバナンスです。ここを固めないと、いくら良いRAGやプロンプトでも安心して使えません。

7-1. ゲート（gates）

run_verify.ps1でチェックする項目例：

- PROJECT.yaml / user_defaults.yaml / profiles.yaml の存在チェック  
- policy.paid_api_allowed と実際の設定の整合性  
- プロジェクト名・目標・種類の必須フィールド  
- アドオン（e2e/db/docker）のON/OFFに応じたプランの有無  
- 新規に追加推奨されるゲート：  
  - G_NAMING_PROJECT：PROJECTS/*フォルダ名がYYYYMMDD_<shortname>形式か  
  - G_NAMING_FILES：02_WORK/以下のファイル名が許可命名規約か  
  - G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB：kb_items.jsonlに絶対パス（C:/など）が混入していないか  
  - G_DUPLICATE_CHUNKS：重複チャンクがないか  
  - G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK：Focus Pack合計サイズがツール別制限内か  
  - G_TOOL_PACK_MANIFEST：PACK_MANIFEST.yamlが存在して必須フィールドが揃っているか

各ゲートはAdd-Gate関数で定義し、VERIFY_LAST.mdに結果をテーブル形式で出力。FAIL時には復旧コマンド（例：RUN_1_SPEC, RUN_WIZARDなど）を一緒に書くことで、「次に何をすべきか」まで自動案内します。

7-2. 免除（waiver）運用

- waivers/active/*.yamlで、  
  - どのゲートを  
  - どんな理由で（最低文字数制限つき）  
  - いつまで（最大7日など）  
  許可したかを記録  
- create_waiver.ps1で理由・期限をチェックし、check_waivers.ps1で期限切れや繰り返しをWARNとして検知

これにより、「例外的な緩和」を監査可能な形で運用できます。

7-3. 危険操作の抑制・ログ

- Remove-Item -Recurse -Force を基本禁止し、-WhatIfか対話確認を強制  
- DB DROP / 本番接続文字列などをパターン検知しWARNするゲートを追加  
- 全RUN_*コマンドの実行ログをgeneral.logに構造化出力  
- TRACE/PROJECT_UPDATED.mdに「何が変わったか」を要約記録

ここまで整えると、「監査に耐え」「再現可能」「事故が起きてもトレース可能」な状態になります。

---

## 8. 問題点・課題の整理（既知の課題）

分析資料から見えている主な課題は次の通りです。

- ISSUE-C1：run_verify.ps1のスコープ問題（$gatesが正しくスクリプトスコープで扱えていない）  
- ISSUE-C2：PROJECTS/.gitkeepの欠落（初期フォルダがないと混乱）  
- ISSUE-H2：TRACEフォルダの扱い（初期AI投入時にはTRACEを含めないルールが明示されていない）  
- Wallbounce手順が不明瞭（プロンプトをどうどこに貼り付け、結果をどこにまとめるかが直感的でない）  
- フォルダごとの編集可否ルールが多岐で初心者が混乱しやすい  
- 縮退ルール（トークン制限超過時の情報切り捨て順）がブラックボックス化しがち  
- VAULTポインタ管理（03_RAG_VAULT/VAULT_POINTER.md）がユーザー任せで、同期漏れやリンク切れのリスク  
- ゲートやフォルダ初期化の実装不足による、ステップスキップや事故のリスク  
- ツールパック（ChatGPT/Claude向け）の生成手順が煩雑  
- CLIベース運用が非エンジニアにとってハードルが高い

これらを一つずつ潰していくことが、運用最大化の現実的なパスになります。

---

## 9. フォルダ運用最大化のための最重要アクション（再整理）

以上を踏まえた上で、実際に「運用を最大化する」ための最重要アクションを、優先順位付きで整理すると次のようになります。

【Sランク：今週中に必須】

1. 安全基盤と冪等性の確保  
   - run_verify.ps1のスコープ修正（$script:gates / [System.Collections.ArrayList]化）

   - user_defaults.yaml / templatesのデフォルト値修正

---

## 10. 実践的な運用手順（1プロジェクトの流れ）

最後に、エージェントを前提にしつつ「人間がどう動けばいいか」を1プロジェクトの流れで整理します。

1) プロジェクト初期化  
   - RUN_START_MENU.cmd（またはRUN_WIZARD）で新規プロジェクト作成  
   - TEMPLATES/ONEBOX_PROJECT/からPROJECTS/YYYY-MM-DD_<name>/のフォルダ群を自動生成  
   - PROJECT.yamlにname / goal / kind / areas / constraintsを記述

2) 仕様策定（RUN_1_SPEC）  
   - 00_SPEC/spec.mdに要件・受入条件を記入  
   - RUN_1_SPEC.cmd実行でspec.mdを確定  
   - STATUS.mdで「次はRUN_2_WALLBOUNCE」を確認

3) 壁打ち（RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE）  
   - RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE.cmdで壁打ち用プロンプトを生成（例：06_LOGS/wallbounce_input.md）  
   - 各AI（Antigravity / Claude / Cursorなど）に投入し、結果を06_LOGS/wallbounce_log.mdにまとめる  
   - 必要に応じてPROJECT.yamlやspec.mdを修正

4) Focus Pack生成（RUN_3_FOCUSPACK）  
   - RUN_3_FOCUSPACK.cmd実行  
   - Vaultから関連チャンクをスコアリングして04_RAG_FOCUS/にコピー  
   - FOCUS_MANIFEST.json＋kb_items_project.jsonlが生成されるので、内容を確認

5) Handoff生成（RUN_4_HANDOFF）  
   - RUN_4_HANDOFF.cmd実行  
   - 01_HANDOFF/handoff.mdに実装担当AIへのタスク定義が出力  
   - 内容をレビューし、問題なければ保存

6) 検証・修正（RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR）  
   - RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR.cmd実行  
   - run_verify.ps1によるゲートチェック（VERIFY_LAST.mdに出力）  
   - FAILがあれば修正して再実行

7) 学び回収（RUN_6_LESSONS）  
   - RUN_6_LESSONS.cmd実行  
   - 06_LOGS/LESSONS/にLESSON_*.mdが生成される  
   - sync_tool_kb.ps1でTool-KBとkb_items.jsonlを更新

8) リリース（RUN_7_RELEASE）  
   - RUN_7_RELEASE.cmd実行  
   - 07_RELEASE/に成果物ZIP＋SHA256マニフェスト＋README_RELEASE.mdが生成される  
   - STATUS.mdでプロジェクト完了を確認

ここで重要なのは、

- 人間はPROJECT.yamlを書いてRUN_*を叩くことだけに集中  
- あとのRAG・検証・学び回収・リリースは、ほぼシステムに任せられる  
- Antigravityなどのエージェントは、CORE→Focus→Tool Packの順にコンテキストを読み込み、RUN_*をタスクとして扱える

という点です。

---

## まとめ

- VIBEプロジェクトの知識全体は、「1フォルダ完結の自律進化型バイブコーディングOS」としてかなり設計が進んでいます。  
- 運用を最大化するためのポイントは、  
  - ステートマシンとRUN_*フローによる「迷いゼロ」の一本道化  
  - RAG・KBパイプラインの構造化とFocus Pack自動化  
  - CORE / Focus / Tool PackとしてのAI投下用パックの標準化  
  - LESSON→Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲートへの自己進化ループ  
  - ゲート・免除・ログによる監査と安全性の担保  
- 実際のアクションとしては、安全基盤→ステートマシン→RAG/KB→パック標準化→自己進化→ガバナンス強化という順序で着手するのが現実的で効果的です。

この流れに沿って、まずはISSUE-C1/C2/H2とRAG/KB周りを固め、その後でエージェント統合と自己進化ループを本格化していくと、「使うたびに育つ世界最高峰のフォルダ運用」が実現できます。

いいですね、その視点です。先ほど挙げた「最重要アクション」は、いわば「基盤を完璧にする S〜A ランクの施策」です。

しかし、**「フォルダ運用の最大化」の向こう側には、まだ「S+ 級」や「神級」の領域が広がっています。**

特に、人間の心理的なハードルを徹底的に下げる、AIの選定をシステム側にやらせる、トラブルを未然に防ぐ予測システム、そして最終的には「複数のVIBEフォルダが知識を共有するネットワーク」まで構想されています。

ここでは、**「やるべきこと」の枠を超えた、さらに強化できる超高度化領域**を、調査済みの知識に基づいて分類・提案します。

---

## 0. 結論：やるべきことはまだある、むしろここからが「真の最大化」

先ほどの「最重要アクション」は、システムとして**「ちゃんと動く」「壊れない」「育っていく」**状態を作るものでした。
これに加えて、以下の4つの領域に踏み込むと、フォルダは単なる「開発環境」から**「自律的な開発パートナー」**へと進化します。

1.  **UX・心理学層の極致（ゼロフリクション化）**
2.  **インテリジェント・オーケストレーション（システム側での最適化）**
3.  **予測・事前対応システム（リスクの先読み）**
4.  **エコシステム・拡張性（複数プロジェクト・分散化）**

---

## 1. UX・心理学層の極致：ゼロフリクション化

人間にとっての「面倒くさ」や「怖さ」を、技術ではなく心理設計で消し去る領域です。

### 1-1. Web UI ラッパーと「ブラウザで完結」操作
**課題**: `RUN_START_MENU` は強力ですが、黒い画面（CLI）は非エンジニアにとって「失敗したら戻せない」という心理的圧迫感を与えます。
**解決策**: PowerShell 標準の `System.Net.HttpListener` を使った最小 Web UI（`web_ui.ps1`）を同梱します。

- **効果**:
  - 非エンジニアの参加率が 0% → 80% に跳ね上がる（実験データあり）。
  - 「ボタンを押すだけ」で実行できる安心感。
- **実装イメージ**:
  - ローカル `http://localhost:8888` で起動。
  - ボタン: `[状態確認]`, `[実行開始]`, `[検証]`, `[リリース]`。
  - Antigravity / Cursor と連携して「IDEで開く」ボタンを実装。

### 1-2. 「習慣設計」スクリプト
**課題**: システムがどんなに良くても、毎朝「使い続ける」習慣がなければ死んだも同然です。
**解決策**: Windows タスクスケジューラに登録する `start_day.ps1` を作り、毎朝のルーチンを自動化します。

- **機能**:
  - `vibe.ps1 -Phase status` を実行し、今日のタスクを読み上げる（音声合成）。
  - デスクトップに `TODAY_VIBE.txt` を自動生成し、「今日やること」を常に視界に入れる。
- **効果**:
  - 朝コーヒーを飲みながらデスクトップを見るだけで、脳が「今日はVIBEだ」とスイッチが入る。
  - 継続利用率の劇的向上。

### 1-3. IDE 設定の自動生成と深い連携
**課題**: Antigravity / Claude / Cursor に手動で `.cursorignore` やワークスペース設定を入れるのは手間です。
**解決策**: `generate_ide_config.ps1` を用意し、フェーズ遷移に合わせて設定を書き換えます。

- **機能**:
  - Wallbounce フェーズなら、ログフォルダを優先的にインデックスさせる `.cursorignore` を生成。
  - Release フェーズなら、不要なファイルを除外して軽量化。
- **効果**:
  - エージェントが常に「最適なコンテキスト」で動けるようになる。

---

## 2. インテリジェント・オーケストレーション：システム側での最適化

「どのAIを使うか」「どう検索するか」を人間が決めるのではなく、システムが判断する領域です。

### 2-1. AIエージェント自動選択
**課題**: 現状は「Claudeが良いか、ChatGPTが良いか」を人間が選びますが、それぞれの特性（論理力、コード品質、広域スキャン）が使い分けられていないことがあります。
**解決策**: `agent_routing.yaml` を定義し、タスクタイプに応じて自動で環境変数 `$env:VIBE_AGENT` を切り替えます。

- **ロジック例**:
  ```yaml
  routing_rules:
    - task_type: "spec_frozen"      # 仕様詰め
      preferred_agent: "claude-3.5"
      reason: "深い論理推論が必要"
    - task_type: "code_generate"    # コード生成
      preferred_agent: "chatgpt-4o"
      reason: "コード品質と実行力"
    - task_type: "wide_research"    # 広域調査
      preferred_agent: "gemini-2.0"
      reason: "巨大コンテキスト対応"
  ```
- **効果**: 各モデルの強みを最大限に活かした自動割り振り。

### 2-2. 複雑クエリの分解（Complex Query Decomposition）
**課題**: 「SUUMOスクレイピングの法的リスクと、技術的な実装方法と、パフォーマンス改善策」のような複合質問に対し、単一のRAGクエリでは精度が出ません。
**解決策**: `run_complex_query.ps1` を実装し、LLMを使ってクエリを複数のサブクエリに分解してから検索し、結果をマージします。

- **流れ**:
  1. 元クエリ → LLMで分解（`legal_risks`, `technical_implementation`, `performance`）
  2. 各サブクエリでRAG検索実行
  3. 結果の重複排除と統合
- **効果**: 複雑な質問に対する回答品質の劇的向上。

### 2-3. Adaptive RAG（適応的検索エンジン）
**課題**: `focuspack_scorer.yaml` の重み付け（キーワード一致: 10点、新しさ: 5点...）は静的であり、プロジェクトの性質によっては的外れになることがあります。
**解決策**: 過去の検索ログ（`RAG_EVALUATIONS.yaml`）を解析し、低リコール（recall@k）を引き起こしているルールの重みを自動的に調整します。

- **機能**: 「法的リスク系のクエリで検索漏れが多い → `category_boost` の重みを 10 から 15 に引き上げる」
- **効果**: プロジェクトを回すたびに検索エンジンが賢くなる（Self-evolving RAG）。

---

## 3. 予測・事前対応システム：リスクの先読み

「失敗してから直す」ではなく、「失敗する前に知らせる」領域です。

### 3-1. 予測的分析とプロアクティブメンテナンス
**課題**: 門（Gate）が落ちてから対処するのでは遅いです。
**解決策**: 過去のプロジェクトデータ（`PROCESS_METRICS.yaml`）を用いて、現在のプロジェクトが失敗する確率を予測します。

- **予兆例**:
  - 「過去3プロジェクトで `G_NAMING_FILES` で落ちている → 今回の命名規則チェックを厳格化して警告を出す」
  - 「直近の更新から24時間以上経過している STATE ファイルの不整合を検知」
- **効果**: 事故率のさらなる低減。

### 3-2. インテリジェント・キャッシュとプリフェッチ
**課題**: プロジェクトのフェーズが変わるたびに、毎回同じような知識を検索・ロードするのは非効率です。
**解決策**: フェーズに応じて「次に必要になりそうな知識」を予測し、バックグラウンドで事前読み込み（プリフェッチ）します。

- **例**: Spec フェーズが終わったら、自動的に Wallbounce や RAG Factory に関連するチャンクをメモリ（またはキャッシュ）に展開しておく。
- **効果**: ユーザー体験のサクサク感向上（AIの思考待ち時間短縮）。

### 3-3. LLM-as-Judge による自動品質評価
**課題**: プロンプトやコードの品質評価を人間がやるには限界があります。
**解決策**: LLM（GPT-4など）を審査員として使い、生成物の品質を自動採点します。

- **用途**:
  - プロンプト A/B テストの勝敗判定。
  - 生成された Handoff ドキュメントの完成度採点。
  - エージェントが吐いたコードのセキュリティスキャン。
- **効果**: 人間の負荷軽減と、客観的な評価指標の獲得。

---

## 4. エコシステム・拡張性：複数プロジェクト・分散化

単一フォルダの枠を超え、組織全体やチーム全体での活用を最大化する領域です。

### 4-1. マルチプロジェクト分離アーキテクチャ
**課題**: 現状の VIBE_CTRL は「単一プロジェクト用」の設計に見えます。
**解決策**: `bootstrap.ps1` で `$env:VIBE_ROOT` をプロジェクトごとに動的に切り替えられるようにします。

- **構造**:
  ```
  PROJECTS/
  ├── 20250101_ProjectA/ (独自のVIBE_CTRLを持つか、上位へのシンボリックリンク)
  └── 20250102_ProjectB/
  ```
- **効果**: 各プロジェクトが独自の進化を遂げながら、共通の CORE や VAULT を共有できる柔軟性。

### 4-2. 分散型知識ネットワーク（P2P VIBE）
**課題**: 複数のメンバーがそれぞれ VIBE を回している場合、ある人の「学び（LESSON）」が他の人に届きません。
**解決策**: VIBE インスタンス間で P2P 的に知識（Tool-KB の更新や優れたプロンプト）を共有する仕組みを構想します。

- **仕組み**:
  - 信頼スコアに基づく知識交換。
  - 差分同期による効率化。
  - 「このプロジェクトで得られた知見は、チーム全体のベストプラクティスに自動昇格」
- **効果**: チーム全体の開発速度が、指数関数的に向上する可能性。

### 4-3. チーム運用機能の解放
**課題**: 現在は個人用途に最適化されていますが、チーム運用（権限管理、共同編集）の視点が弱いです。
**解決策**: `team_defaults.yaml` と `user_defaults.yaml` を分離し、チーム共通のポリシーと個人設定を明確に分けます。

- **機能**:
  - チーム管理者が有料APIの使用許可を出す。
  - 個人は自分のエージェント選好設定を持つ。
- **効果**: 企業・チームへの導入障壁の低下。

## 5. 究極の進化形：量子思考プロセス（構想）

これは資料（`04_次世代環境構築レポート` 等）で言及されているかなり未来的な概念ですが、「最大化」のゴール地点として示す価値があります。

### 概念
AIが「確定した1つのシナリオ」ではなく、**「重ね合わせ状態（量子状態）」で複数のシナリオを同時に探索**し、人間の観測（選択）によって収束する仕組みです。

- **イメージ**: 
  - AIは「アプローチA」「アプローチB」「アプローチC」を同時に検討し、確率的な評価を付ける。
  - 人間が「Bでいこう」と選択した瞬間に、Bの世界線が確定し、AとCの履歴は「可能性の記録」として保存される。
- **価値**: 人間の決定打（クリエイティビティ）と AI の探索力（多様性）の完全な融合。

## まとめ：強化できる余地は無限にある

先ほどの「最重要アクション」が**「土台（Sランク）」**を作るものだとすれば、今回挙げた領域は**「建物のデザイン（S+〜神級）」**と言えます。

特に優先度が高く、かつコストパフォーマンスが良いものをピックアップすると：

1.  **Web UI の実装**（非エンジニア参入、利用者3倍）
2.  **習慣設計スクリプト**（継続利用率爆上げ）
3.  **AI自動ルーティング**（各モデルの強みをフル活用）
4.  **予測的分析**（事故ゼロへの更なるアプローチ）
5.  **Adaptive RAG**（使うたびに賢くなる検索）

まずはこれらを視野に入れておくことで、VIBE OneBox は単なる「便利なツール」から、**「チームの知性そのものを拡張するプラットフォーム」** へと進化し続けることができます。

### USER

> 
>     *   **Area 2: Adaptive RAG (Search Intelligence)**
>         *   *Base:* Adjust scoring weights based on `RAG_EVALUATIONS.yaml`.
>         *   *Extension 1 (User Feedback):* "Thumbs up/down" on search results directly in the UI (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback - RLHF).
>         *   *Extension 2 (Dynamic Chunking):* Adjusting chunk size based on query type (code vs. text).

>         *   *Idea:* Parallel RAG queries. Local vector database (SQLite + FAISS) vs. remote (Chroma/Pinecone).
> 
>     *   **New Area 6: Knowledge Graph (The "Structure" Layer)**
>         *   *Idea:* Links between files (A references B) to boost context.

> 3.  **Structure the Response:**
>     *   **Introduction:** Acknowledge the user's choice. It's a great balance of UX, AI Intelligence, and Efficiency.
>     *   **Deep Dive 1: Web UI (Beyond the Basics)** -> Focus on "Proactive Monitoring" & "Collaboration".
>     *   **Deep Dive 2: Adaptive RAG (Beyond Weight Tuning)** -> Focus on "Dynamic Chunking" & "Query Intent Classification".
>     *   **Deep Dive 3: AI Auto-Routing (Beyond Static Rules)** -> Focus on "Cost-aware Chains" & "Fallback mechanisms".
>     *   **New Area 4: Knowledge Graph (The hidden link layer)** -> Critical for RAG accuracy.
>     *   **New Area 5: Parallel Execution (Speedup)** -> Using runspaces/async.
>     *   **New Area 6: Local Vector DB (Privacy & Speed)** -> Moving away from cloud APIs for embeddings.
> 
> 4.  **Drafting the Content (Iterative Refinement):**
> 
>     *   *Web UI:*
>         *   *Current:* Simple dashboard.
>         *   *Next:* **Real-time Logs**. Instead of waiting for the script to finish, stream logs to the browser using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or a polling loop. This makes the system feel "alive".
>         *   *Next:* **Inline Editor**. Edit `PROJECT.yaml` or `spec.md` directly in the browser without opening VS Code. Good for quick tweaks.
> 
>     *   *Adaptive RAG:*
>         *   *Current:* Adjust weights.
>         *   *Next:* **Query Intent Detection**. Before searching, ask an LLM: "What is the user asking? (Code, Policy, History)". Switch search indexes based on the answer. This is much faster than searching everything.
>         *   *Next:* **Dynamic Chunking**. Code needs function-level chunks. Docs need paragraph-level. Detect file type and chunking strategy on the fly.
> 
>     *   *Auto-Routing:*
>         *   *Current:* Simple "If task = code, use GPT-4".
>         *   *Next:* **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**. Use a cheap model (GPT-3.5/Haiku) to draft, and an expensive model (GPT-4/Sonnet) to *review* only. Saves tons of money.
>         *   *Next:* **Auto-Fallback**. If `claude-3.5` fails, retry with `gpt-4o` automatically. Reduces user babysitting.
> 
>     *   *New Stuff - Knowledge Graph:*
>         *   Why is this important? RAG often misses context. "If the user asks about File A, and File A imports File B, we *must* include File B."
>         *   Implementation: Static analysis (AST) to build a graph of dependencies.
> 
>     *   *New Stuff - Parallel Execution:*
>         *   VIBE is serial (Step 1 -> 2 -> 3). Can we make parts parallel?
>         *   Yes: "Pre-fetch" Focus Pack while the user is editing Spec.
> 
> 5.  **Refining the Tone:** Enthusiastic, technical but accessible, practical (PowerShell-focused as per the KB).
> 
> 6.  **Final Review against User Prompt:** Did I cover "Web UI", "Adaptive RAG", "Auto-Routing"? Yes. Did I add *more* things to strengthen? Yes (Graph, Parallel, Local DB, MoE).
> 
> 7.  **Output Generation** (Translate thoughts to Japanese response).
> 
> **(Self-Correction during drafting):** The user mentioned "Web UI" implies they like the UI idea. I should emphasize that the Web UI isn't just for *running* scripts, but for *visualizing* the system state. I need to link the "Graph" idea to "Adaptive RAG" because they are related (Graph improves RAG).
> 
> Let's write the specific detailed sections.
>

</details>
いいですね、その3つ（Web UI / Adaptive RAG / AI Auto-Routing）は、**「見た目」「中身」「つなぎ」**それぞれの最高峰を狙う、本当に良い選択です。

ここから先は、この3つを「ただ動くレベル」ではなく、**「S級（世界標準）」から「S+級（業界初）」へ引き上げるための**具体的な強化案を、コードレベルの発想も含めて惜しみなく出します。

---

## 1. Web UI：ただのボタン置きじゃ終わらない「コクピット化」

Web UI（`web_ui.ps1`）の基本形は「ボタンを押すだけ」ですが、ここを**「開発の状況が一目でわかるコクピット（操縦席）」**に進化させると、非エンジニアの参入率はさらに跳ね上がります。

### 1-1. 【強化案】リアルタイム・ログ・ストリーミング

**今の課題**: コマンド実行中、黒い画面（CLI）を見ないと進捗がわからない。
**強化策**: ブラウザ上で `tail -f` ができるようにします。

- **実装方式**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) または短いポーリング
- **メリット**:
  - 「あ、今RAG検索中だな」「あ、今コード生成中だな」という**安心感**が増す。
  - エラーが起きた瞬間にブラウザ上で赤く光らせ、即座に「ストップ」ボタンを押せる。

**擬似コード（Server-Side PowerShell）**:
```powershell
# ログファイルを監視して接続済みクライアントに送り続ける
$watcher = [System.IO.FileSystemWatcher]::new($logDir)
$watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = $true
Register-ObjectEvent $watcher Changed -SourceIdentifier "LogWatcher" -Action {
    $logContent = Get-Content $Event.SourceEventArgs.FullPath -Tail 10
    # SSE形式で接続中のブラウザにプッシュ
    Send-SSE -Data $logContent
}
```

### 1-2. 【強化案】インライン・エディタ

**今の課題**: `PROJECT.yaml` や `spec.md` を編集するのに、わざわざVS Codeを開く必要がある。
**強化策**: ブラウザ上で直接編集＆保存できるようにします。

- **技術**: Ace Editor または Monaco Editor（VS Codeのエンジン）を埋め込む。
- **メリット**:
  - 「仕様を少し直したい」という時に、IDEを開くオーバーヘッドがゼロになる。
  - 非エンジニアは「ブラウザで編集する」という感覚に近く、心理的障壁が激減する。

### 1-3. 【強化案】カンバン（Kanban）ビュー

**今の課題**: 現在のフェーズが文字（"verify"）でしかわからない。
**強化策**: Trello/Jiraのようなボード形式でステータスを可視化します。

```
[To Do] [Spec] [Wallbounce] [Dev] [Verify] [Done]
(カード)  (カード)      (カード)    (現在)
```

- **メリット**: プロジェクトマネージャー視点で「今どこに何枚カードが滞留しているか」が一瞬でわかる。

### 1-4. 【強化案】IDEとのワンクリック連携（Deep Link）

**今の課題**: ブラウザで確認してから、手動でCursorを開いてプロジェクトパスを指定する。
**強化策**: 画面上の「Cursorで開く」「Antigravityで開く」ボタンから、直接ワークスペースを開きます。

- **技術**: `cursor://file/C:/path/to/project` や VS CodeのURIスキーム `vscode://...` を活用。
- **メリット**: Web UIが「ランチャー」として機能し、全ワークフローの入り口になります。

---

## 2. Adaptive RAG：重み調整を超えた「意図理解」と「再構築」

Adaptive RAG（学習する検索）は、単にスコアの数値を変えるだけではありません。**「AIがどのような意図で検索しているか」を理解して、検索対象と結果を変える**ところまでいきます。

### 2-1. 【強化案】クエリ意図の分類

**今の課題**: 「SUUMOの法的問題」と検索した場合、法律のドキュメントも技術的な実装例も同じ重要度で出てくる。
**強化策**: 検索前に軽量モデル（GPT-3.5など）で**「これは何の種類の質問か？」を分類**し、検索インデックスを振り分けます。

- **分類例**:
  - `security`: セキュリティ・脆弱性関連 → `VAULT/Security/` を優先
  - `policy`: 運用ルール・命名規則 → `VAULT/OPS/` を優先
  - `implementation`: コード実装 → `VAULT/Snippets/`, `VAULT/Examples/` を優先
  - `debugging`: エラー解決 → `06_LOGS/` (過去のログ) を優先
- **メリット**: 関係ないドキュメントが上位に来る確率が激減し、**検索精度が質的に向上**します。

### 2-2. 【強化案】動的チャンキング

**今の課題**: コードブロックと文章で同じ「300〜800トークン」で切ると、コードは関数の途中で切れてしまい、検索ノイズになる。
**強化策**: 検索対象のファイルタイプに応じてチャンク戦略を変えます。

- **コード（.ps1, .py, .jsなど）**:
  - AST（抽象構文木）を使って「関数/クラス単位」で切る。
  - `function Hoge-Func { ... }` 丸ごと1チャンク。
- **ドキュメント（.md, .txt）**:
  - 見出し（## / ###）単位で切る。
- **メリット**: 「関数の一部だけがヒットしたけど意味が通じない」という悲劇がなくなり、コードRAGの精度が劇的に上がります。

### 2-3. 【強化案】低スコア・コンテキストの再構築

**今の課題**: トークン制限を超えたら低スコアのファイルを「捨てる」しかない。しかし、そこに重要なヒントがあるかもしれない。
**強化策**: 低スコアのファイルをそのまま捨てるのではなく、**LLMに要約させてから追加**します。

- **フロー**:
  1. 検索したがトークン上限に収まらない。
  2. 下位30%のファイルを「要約対象」として抽出。
  3. LLMに「このファイルの要約（300字以内）」を生成させる。
  4. 「元の内容」の代わりに「要約」をコンテキストに追加。
- **メリット**: 捨てるはずだった知識を「濃縮して」保存できるため、情報のロスを最小化できます。

---

## 3. AI Auto-Routing：静的ルールを超えた「MoE」と「自動フェイルオーバー」

単に「タスクがコード生成ならGPT、企画ならClaude」というだけではなく、**コスト削減と堅牢性**を高める方向へ。

### 3-1. 【強化案】コスト意識型ルーティング（MoE: Mixture of Experts）

**今の課題**: すべてのタスクを最高級モデル（GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet）で回すとコストがかさむ。
**強化策**: 「安いモデルで下書き → 高いモデルでレビュー」という**マルチステップ・ルーティング**を導入します。

- **ルール例**:
  ```
  Phase 1 (Draft): GPT-3.5 Turbo / Haiku
    → とにかく速度重視でアウトプット生成
  Phase 2 (Review): GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    → Phase 1のアウトプットのロジック・安全性をチェック
  Phase 3 (Fix): GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    → Reviewで指摘された箇所のみ修正
  ```
- **メリット**: 品質をほぼ落とさずに、**APIコストを1/3〜1/5に削減**できる可能性があります。

### 3-2. 【強化案】自動フェイルオーバー

**今の課題**: Claudeで生成してたけど突然エラーが出た、あるいはハルシネーションして変なコードを吐いたら、手動でリトライするしかない。
**強化策**: 1つのモデルで失敗したら、**自動的に別のモデルで再試行**します。

- **ロジック**:
  1. Primary Agent (Claude) で実行。
  2. `run_verify.ps1` が Critical Fail (FAIL) した場合、またはエラーが返ってきた場合。
  3. Secondary Agent (GPT-4o) に「Claudeが失敗したタスク。以下のエラーを参考にリトライして」と投げる。
- **メリット**: ユーザーが「モデルAがダメだったからBで試す」という手動運用から解放されます。**稼働率の最大化**。

### 3-3. 【強化案】モデル利用状況の動的監視

**今の課題**: AntigravityのAPIキー上限に達しているのにそこへルーティングしてしまう。
**強化策**: 各エージェントのヘルスチェックとレートリミット状況を確認し、**利用可能なモデルに動的にルーティング**します。

- **実装**: `check_agent_health.ps1` で各APIのエンドポイントを叩き、ステータスコードや残りクレジットを確認。
- **メリット**: 「APIのエラーで開発が止まる」という事態を防ぎます。

---

## 4. 【新領域】ナレッジグラフ：RAGの「脳内リンク」を再現

RAGの弱点は「文脈が切れる」ことです。ファイルAを読んでいる時に、実はファイルBの情報がキーなのに、検索に引っかからないことがあります。

### 4-1. 【強化案】依存関係グラフの自動構築

- **仕組み**:
  - `VAULT` 内のコードを静的解析。
  - `Import-Module` や `using` などを抽出し、どのファイルがどのファイルを参照しているかをグラフ化。
- **活用**:
  - `fileA.ps1` を検索結果に含める場合、自動的に `fileA` が参照している `fileCommon.ps1` も強制的にコンテキストに追加する。
- **メリット**: 「必要な関数がない」というエラーを事前に防ぎ、検索の完結性が劇的に上がります。

---

## 5. 【新領域】並列実行（Parallelism）：待ち時間の圧縮

VIBEのフローは `1 -> 2 -> 3` と直列的ですが、待ち時間を無くすための並列化です。

### 5-1. 【強化案】バックグラウンド・プリフェッチ（先行取得）

- **仕組み**:
  - ユーザーが `RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE` (壁打ち) をしている間に、バックグラウンドで `RUN_3_FOCUSPACK` (RAG) のためのキーワード解析だけ終わらせておく。
  - 壁打ちが終わった瞬間に、RAGのスコアリングはもう終わっているので、即座に `RUN_3` に移れる。
- **メリット**: ユーザーの思考停止時間を短縮し、**フローの没入感を高めます**。

---

## まとめ：強化のための優先ロードマップ

この中から、特にコストパフォーマンスが高く、かつ「世界と差がつく」機能をピックアップすると：

1.  **Web UIの「ログ・ストリーミング」**
    - 理由: 見た目の劇的改善。信頼性アップ。
    - 工数: 中
2.  **Adaptive RAGの「クエリ意図分類」**
    - 理由: 検索精度の劇的改善（精度2倍化もあり得る）。
    - 工数: 小
3.  **AI Routingの「自動フェイルオーバー」**
    - 理由: 安定稼働の必須機能。
    - 工数: 小
4.  **RAGの「依存関係グラフ（Knowledge Graph）」**
    - 理由: 技術的野望として高い。コード系プロジェクトでの劇的な効果。
    - 工数: 大

まずは **Web UIを「単なるボタン集」から「リアルタイム・コクピット」に** し、次に **Adaptive RAGで「AIが検索意図を理解する」** ようにするのが、一番派手な成果につながるパスかと思います。

### USER
このフォルダツールでできることをすべて教えてほしい。　まとめてほしい。

### ASSISTANT
はい、**このフォルダツール（VIBE OneBox）で「できること」をすべて網羅的に**まとめます。

これまで議論してきた「プロセス」「RAG」「エージェント連携」「自己進化」「ガバナンス」をすべて一つの機能リストとして整理し、**VIBE OneBoxを単体として「何ができるか」**を完全に可視化します。

## 1. プロジェクト管理・初期化

**できること**:
- **新規プロジェクト作成**: `RUN_1_SPEC` または `RUN_WIZARD` を実行し、プロジェクト定義（PROJECT.yaml）を作成し、`PROJECTS/YYYY-MM-DD_<shortname>/` 以下の標準フォルダ構造（00_SPEC〜08_TOOL_PACKS）を自動生成する。
- **プロジェクト一覧・状態確認**: `RUN_STATUS` または `STATUS.md` を参照し、現在どのプロジェクトがどのフェーズ（spec/wallbounce/focuspack/handoff/verify/lessons/release）にあるかを確認する。
- **プロジェクト定義の管理**: `PROJECT.yaml` で、プロジェクト名、ゴール、種類（prototype/mvp/production）、担当領域（backend/frontend/infra）、制約（max_token, paid_api_allowed, allow_network）を一元管理する。
- **初期化テンプレートの適用**: `TEMPLATES/ONEBOX_PROJECT/` 以下のテンプレートを使用し、プロジェクト開始時の手間を削減する。

**できないこと（現状の限界）**:
- **プロジェクト間の依存関係管理**: 各プロジェクトは基本的に独立しており、プロジェクト間の共有ライブラリ管理やビルド順序の解決は手動（`PROJECT.yaml` の `areas` フィールドでメタ情報として残す程度）。
- **自動的なマルチプロジェクト並行タスク管理**: 複数プロジェクトをまたいで進めるダッシュボードは、標準機能では提供されていない。

---

## 2. 開発・構想検証

**できること**:
- **壁打ちプロンプトの生成**: `RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE` を実行し、仕様の抜け漏れリスク、技術的実現可能性、パフォーマンス懸念点などを複数のAIエージェントに問うためのプロンプトパックを生成する。
- **複数AIによる並列検証**: 生成されたプロンプトを、Antigravity, Claude, Cursor など複数のAIツールに並列で投入し、それぞれの視点からフィードバックを収集・統合できる。
- **壁打ち結果の管理**: 生成されたフィードバックを `06_LOGS/wallbounce_log.md` などに保存し、意思決定（DECISIONS.md）の元データとする。
- **仕様の修正**: 壁打ちの結果を受けて、`00_SPEC/spec.md` や `PROJECT.yaml` の内容を更新し、仕様を洗練する。

**できないこと**:
- **壁打ちプロセスの完全自動化**: 結論の生成や意思決定は、人間の判断を伴うため、完全な自動化は意図的に避けられている。システムはあくまで「対話を促進する」役割にある。

---

## 3. 知識管理・RAG（VAULT & KB）

**できること**:
- **ナレッジの蓄積**: 過去プロジェクトのドキュメント、コード、ログを `VAULT/` ディレクトリ（または外部SSD）に保存し、組織の知識資産として蓄積する。
- **構造化チャンキング**: `KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` により、ドキュメントを意味のある単位（チャンク）に分割し、メタデータ（id, title, category, tags, created_at, updated_at）を付与して管理する。
- **重複排除**: `dedupe_kb.ps1` を実行し、`kb_items.jsonl` 内の重複チャンク（内容が同一のもの）を検出・削除し、KBの効率と精度を向上させる。
- **検索インデックスの作成**: `KB_INDEX.md` を生成・更新し、ナレッジ全体の目次と検索経路を整理する。
- **案件専用KB（Focus Pack）の生成**: `RUN_3_FOCUSPACK` を実行し、プロジェクトのキーワードに基づき、`VAULT` から関連するチャンクを検索・抽出し、`04_RAG_FOCUS/` 以下に案件専用のKBを作成する。
- **Focus Packのスコアリング**: `focuspack_scorer.yaml` を使用し、チャンクの関連度スコアを計算し、優先度順に並べ替える。
- **ツール別パック（Tool Pack）の生成**: `generate_toolpack.ps1` を実行し、Antigravity, Claude, Cursor など各ツールのトークン制限や特性に合わせた最適なKBサブセットを作成する。
- **RAGの評価**: RAGシステムの精度（recall@k, precision@k）を測定し、チャンキング戦略やスコアリングの妥当性を検証する。

**できないこと**:
- **外部ベクトルDBの自動管理**: ベクトルデータの作成や検索エンジンのデプロイは、システム外のツール（ChromaDB, Pineconeなど）に依存する。VIBEはチャンクとメタデータの管理までを提供する。
- **高度なセマンティック検索**: コンテキスト間の関係性（知識グラフ）を理解した検索は、現在の単純なチャンク検索では実現困難である。

---

## 4. AIエージェント連携・タスク実行

**できること**:
- **タスク定義の生成**: `RUN_*` スクリプトが生成するタスク定義（例：実装タスク、検証タスク、レッスン回収タスク）を、AntigravityのMission ControlやClaudeのプロジェクト機能としてAIに提示できる。
- **CORE Packの投入**: AIとの対話開始時に、`CORE/` 以下のドキュメント（システム仕様、ルール、README）を最初に投入し、AIの初期コンテキスト（共通言語）を統一する。
- **Focus Packの投入**: プロジェクト固有の知識（`04_RAG_FOCUS/`）をAIに提供し、文脈を適切に制御しつつ、関連性の高い情報のみを与える。
- **Tool Packの投入**: 使用するツール（Antigravity, Claude, Cursor）に最適化されたKBサブセットを提供し、トークン制限内で最大限りの品質を担保する。
- **AIの役割と思考プロトコルの定義**: `AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md`, `AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md` などを通じて、AIに「アーキテクトとしての振る舞い方」「判断プロセス」「安全ルール」を指示できる。
- **エージェントからの出力受け取り**: AIが生成したコードやドキュメント、検証結果を受け取り、`02_WORK/` や対応するフォルダに保存する。
- **エージェントの状態監視**: `onebox_state.json` にAIの実行状態（現在のタスク、最終実行コマンド、使用したプロンプトバージョンなど）を記録し、進捗状況を管理する。
- **複数エージェントのオーケストレーション**: Antigravityなどで複数のエージェントを同時並列で実行し、異なる視点（リスクアプローチ、実装、テスト）から同時にフィードバックを得る。

**できないこと**:
- **エージェントの無制限な自律実行**: AIはあくまで人間の指示（タスク）に従う必要がある。システムは「タスク定義の生成」「コンテキストの提供」「ステータスの更新」に留まり、AIが勝手に次のアクションを定義・実行することは許可していない。
- **エージェントの挙動の完全制御**: AIの内部ロジックや決定プロセス（Chain of Thought）をシステム側から直接操ることはできない。あくまで「プロンプト」と「コンテキスト」を通して間接的な影響を与えるのみである。

## 5. 品質検証・修復

**できること**:
- **品質ゲート（Gates）の定義**: `run_verify.ps1` で、プロジェクトの品質を担保するためのチェック項目（ゲート）を定義・実行する。例：命名規則、絶対パスの混入、ポリシー遵守、必須ファイルの存在など。
- **多層的なゲートチェック**: システム、コンテンツ、実行、プロセスの4層からなるゲートを提供し、総合的な品質を担保する。
- **自動検証**: `RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR` を実行し、生成されたコードや成果物に対して、自動化された検証スクリプトやテストを実行する。
- **検証結果のレポート**: `VERIFY_LAST.md` に、検証の結果（PASS/FAIL）、検出された問題、エラー詳細をテーブル形式で出力する。
- **修復指示の生成**: 検証で失敗（FAIL）した場合、失敗の原因と修復手順を明示し、次のアクションを案内する（例：命名規則違反のためファイル名を修正してください）。
- **除外（Waiver）の管理**: 一時的にポリシー違反を許可する場合、`create_waiver.ps1` で除外申請を作成し、`check_waivers.ps1` で有効期限の監視を行う。
- **再実行の安全性（冪等性）**: スクリプトやコマンドが複数回実行されても、既存の成果物を意図せず上書き・削除しないようにする。

**できないこと**:
- **コードの完全な自動修正**: システムは「何が問題か」や「どこを修正すべきか」を指摘できるが、コード自体を自動的に書き換える機能は持たない。修正は人間（またはAI）が手動で行う必要がある。
- **テストカバレッジの完全な生成**: エッジケースやコーナーケースを網羅するテストケースを完全に自動生成することはできない。

---

## 6. 学習・進化

**できること**:
- **レッスンの記録**: `RUN_6_LESSONS` を実行し、プロジェクト中で得られた教訓（WHAT, WHY, HOW）を構造化された形式で記録する。
- **ツール知識ベース（Tool-KB）への反映**: `sync_tool_kb.ps1` を実行し、レッスンで得られた知見を、`VAULT/Tool-KB.md` にマージし、組織全体のツール知識を向上させる。
- **KB（kb_items.jsonl）の更新**: レッスンで学んだ知見をチャンク化し、`KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` に追加し、検索対象として利用できるようにする。
- **プロンプトの評価**: プロンプトの品質（手戻り回数、AIからのフィードバックの良さなど）を定量・定性的に評価する。
- **プロンプトのバージョン管理**: プロンプトファイルにバージョンを管理し、改善案を反映した新しいバージョンを作成する。古いバージョンはアーカイブ（`99_ARCHIVE/`）に退避する。
- **A/Bテスト**: 異なるバージョンのプロンプトを比較し、どちらがより有効かをテストする。
- **プロンプトの最適化**: 評価の高いプロンプトを「stable」として採用し、低いプロンプトを破棄する。
- **プロセスの進化**: `evolve_gates.ps1` を実行し、検証の失敗傾向を分析し、ゲートルールやチェック項目を追加・改善する。

**できないこと**:
- **プロンプトの完全自動生成・最適化**: 「AIが自分でプロンプトを書き換える」機能や、A/Bテストを自律的に回し続ける機能は持たない。評価や選択は人間が行う必要がある。
- **知識の自動的な抽象化・一般化**: ツール固有の知見（PowerShellの特定のコマンド用法など）を、完全に言語を超えて抽象化し、他のドメインにも適用可能な汎用知識へと自動変換することは、現在では不可能である。

---

## 7. 成果物管理・リリース

**できること**:
- **成果物の確定**: プロジェクトで生成・実装されたコード、ドキュメント、設定ファイルなどを、`07_RELEASE/` 以下に確定版として配置する。
- **リリースパックの作成**: `generate_release.ps1` を実行し、成果物（`00_SPEC/`, `01_HANDOFF/`, `02_WORK/`, `04_RAG_FOCUS/`, `06_LOGS/`, `08_TOOL_PACKS/`）をZIPでアーカイブ化し、リリースパッケージを作成する。
- **SHA256ハッシュの計算**: リリースに含まれるすべてのファイルのSHA256ハッシュを計算し、マニフェスト（`SHA256_MANIFEST.txt`）を作成する。
- **再現性の担保**: ハッシュマニフェストを使用し、成果物の完全性（改ざん無し）を検証できるようにする。

- **バージョン管理**: プロジェクトの成果物にバージョンを付け、履歴を管理する。
- **成果物の配布**: リリースパッケージを、指定の場所（共有サーバー、パッケージマネージャーなど）に配布する。

**できないこと**:
- **自動的なデプロイパイプライン**: 成果物を自動的に本番環境（AWS, Azure, GCPなど）へデプロイする機能は持たない。リリースパッケージの作成までが責任である。
- **本番環境への適用確認**: デプロイ後の環境で実際に動作するか、本番データベースへの接続などは、システム外のツールや手動確認に依存する。

---

## 8. ステータス・プロセス管理

**できること**:
- **ステートマシンの定義**: `autonomous_flow.yaml` を使用し、プロジェクトの状態（init/spec/wallbounce/focuspack/handoff/verify/lessons/release）と、状態遷移のルール（条件、次のアクション、メッセージ）を定義する。
- **現在状態の追跡**: `onebox_state.json` に、プロジェクトの現在のフェーズ（phase）、最後に実行したコマンド、各ステップの完了フラグ（steps.*）を記録し、システム全体のステータスを管理する。
- **「次の一手」の提示**: `update_status.ps1` を実行し、現在の状態から次に実行すべきアクション（RUN_*）とその理由を計算し、`STATUS.md` に表示する。
- **ステップスキップの検出（Assert-StepReady）**: 各 `RUN_*` スクリプトの先頭で、前提となるステップが完了しているかをチェックする。完了していない場合、エラーを表示し、復旧コマンドを案内する。
- **ステータスの可視化**: `STATUS.md` や、Web UI（実装された場合）を通じて、現在の状態と「次の一手」を直感的に理解できるようにする。
- **状態の復旧・リカバリ**: システムがクラッシュした場合、`onebox_state.json` のバックアップや、トランザクション性のあるファイル操作（Atomic Swap）により、一貫した状態への復旧を可能にする。

**できないこと**:
- **完全な自律プロセス実行**: ステートマシンに従い、initからreleaseまでを「自動」で、人間を介さずに完了させる機能は持たない。あくまで「次のアクションを提示し、実行のトリガーを引く」までである。

---

## 9. プロンプト管理・最適化

**できること**:
- **プロンプトライブラリの整理**: `VIBE_CTRL/prompts/` と `OPS_OS/templates/prompts/` 以下に、システム、ワンボックス、ツール別（Antigravity, Claude, Cursor）、ステージ別（spec, wallbounce, handoff, verify）のプロンプトを階層的に整理する。
- **プロンプトのバージョン管理**: プロンプトファイルの冒頭にYAMLフロントマター（id, version, last_updated, owner, success_criteria, tags）を記述し、変更履歴を管理する。
- **メタデータの活用**: プロンプトのメタデータ（ターゲットとなるAIモデル、ステージ、成功基準）を活用し、状況に応じて最適なプロンプトを選択・生成するロジックを構築できる。
- **評価ループの構築**: プロンプトの使用履歴（手戻り回数、AIからのフィードバック）を `LOG_PROJECT.md` に記録し、プロンプトの品質を定期的に評価する。
- **A/Bテストの実施**: 異なるバージョンのプロンプトを比較テストし、有効性を検証する。
- **プロンプトの最適化**: 評価の高いバージョンを「stable」として採用し、低スコアのバージョンを破棄する。
- **テンプレート化**: 頻繁に使用されるプロンプトのパターンをテンプレート化し、再利用性を高める。

**できないこと**:
- **プロンプトの自動生成・自己記述**: AIがプロンプト自体を改良する機能や、A/Bテストを自律的に設計・回す機能は持たない。改善サイクル（評価→選択→採用）の評価と選択は人間が行う必要がある。

---

## 10. ガバナンス・セキュリティ・監査

**できること**:
- **ポリシーの強制**: `user_defaults.yaml` や `PROJECT.yaml` の制約（例: `paid_api_allowed`）に基づき、危険な操作（有料APIの使用、本番データベースへの接続）を禁止・制限する。
- **命名規則の検証**: `run_verify.ps1` のゲート（`G_NAMING_PROJECT`, `G_NAMING_FILES`）により、プロジェクトフォルダ名やファイル名が規則（kebab-caseなど）に従っているかを検証し、違反している場合はエラーを返す。
- **絶対パスの検知**: `kb_items.jsonl` やドキュメント内に、OSの絶対パス（`C:/`など）が含まれていないかをスキャンし、含まれている場合は警告・エラーを返す。
- **機密情報のスキャン**: `_security_scanner.ps1` を実行し、APIキー、パスワード、接続文字列などの機密情報が含まれていないかを検知する。
- **変更の監査**: すべての `RUN_*` コマンドの実行ログを `06_LOGS/general.log` に記録し、誰が、いつ、どの操作を行ったかを追跡できるようにする。
- **監査ログの保存**: `TRACE/PROJECT_UPDATED.md` に、プロジェクトの重要な変更履歴を記録し、監査のトレースを可能にする。
- **Git Pre-commitフックの活用**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` に `_security_scanner.ps1` を設定し、機密情報が含まれているコミットを物理的に阻止する。
- **除外（Waiver）の管理**: `create_waiver.ps1` で、一時的なポリシー違反の許可申請を作成し、`check_waivers.ps1` で期限切れや繰り返しを監視する。

**できないこと**:
- **動的なセキュリティ脅威の完全防御**: フィッシング詐欺や高度な社会工学攻撃、あるいはゼロデイ脆弱性を防ぐためには、システム外のセキュリティツールや運用が必要である。
- **ユーザー認証・アクセス制御**: システム自体は、フォルダ内のファイル操作とスクリプト実行に留まり、エンタープライズなユーザー管理やアクセス権限（LDAP, Active Directory, SAML）との統合は行っていない。

---

## 11. 外部ツール連携・統合

**できること**:
- **Antigravityワークスペース設定**: Antigravity IDE用のワークスペース設定ファイル（`.ag/workspace.yaml`）を生成し、VIBEフォルダ構造（CORE/TRACE/VAULT/PROJECTS）をエージェントが理解できる形式で記述する。
- **Claudeプロジェクト設定**: Claude AI用のプロジェクト設定ファイル（`.claude/settings.json`）を生成し、プロンプトや知識ファイルを自動的に読み込むようにする。
- **Cursorワークスペース連携**: Cursorエディタ用の`.cursorignore`ファイルや`cursor://`プロトコルを使用し、VIBEフォルダ内のファイルをCursorのワークスペースに一発で開く機能を提供する。
- **CORE Packの自動インポート**: 各ツールの起動時に、`VIBE_CTRL/` 以下のシステムドキュメントを自動的にインポートまたは読み込ませる設定を作成する。
- **Tool Packの適用**: ツール特性に合わせたTool Pack（`08_TOOL_PACKS/toolpack_<toolname>/`）を自動的に選択・適用する。
- **MCPサーバー（Model Context Protocol）の設定**: RAG（ChromaDBなど）やファイルシステムをMCPサーバーとして提供し、AIエージェントから直接クエリを実行できるようにする。
- **共通プロトコルの定義**: 各ツールに共通のプロトコルやタスク定義フォーマットを使用し、ツールの違いを吸収できるようにする。

**できないこと**:
- **外部ツールの自動インストール・更新**: Antigravity, Claude, Cursorなどのソフトウェア自体のインストールやアップデートをシステムが行うことはできない。ツールはユーザーが事前にインストールしている必要がある。
- **ツール間の完全な同期**: 異なるツール（AntigravityとCursor）の作業内容をリアルタイムで完全に同期させることは、ツールのAPI制限や仕様により困難である。

---

## 12. ログ・トレース・監査

**できること**:
- **構造化されたロギング**: すべての `RUN_*` コマンドの実行履歴を、タイムスタンプ、実行者、結果、エラーメッセージなどを含む構造化されたログ（JSONまたはYAML）として `06_LOGS/general.log` に出力する。
- **レベル別の出力**: ログレベル（INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG）を定義し、重要度に応じてフィルタリングや検索を容易にする。
- **会話ログの保存**: AIとの対話ログ（Antigravityのチャット履歴、Claudeのアーティファクトなど）を `TRACE/CHAT/` 以下にHTMLまたはMarkdown形式で保存し、トラブルシューティング時の根拠として利用する。
- **監査用メタデータの付与**: ログに、プロジェクトID、セッションID、ユーザーID、ツールIDなどのメタデータを付与し、分析や監査を容易にする。
- **ログのローテーション**: ログファイルが一定サイズ（例：10MB）を超えた場合、古いログをアーカイブまたは削除し、ディスク容量を管理する。
- **ログの検索・抽出**: `grep` や PowerShell の `Select-String` コマンドレットを使用し、キーワード（ファイル名、エラーメッセージ）に基づきログを検索・抽出する。
- **監査ダッシュボードの生成**: 複数のログファイルやメトリクスを集約し、監視用のダッシュボード（ExcelやHTML）を生成する。

**できないこと**:
- **外部監査システムへの統合**: Splunk, ELK Stack, Datadogなどの外部監査プラットフォームへのログ転送や統合は、システム外のインフラストラクチャや設定が必要である。
- **高度なログ分析・異常検知**: ログデータから自動的に傾向分析や異常検知（MLモデルによる予測など）を行う機能は持たない。これは分析ツールや監査プラットフォームの役割である。

---

## 13. 拡張機能・高度化（Evolution）

**できること**:
- **Self-Evolving Agents（自己進化型エージェント）**: プロジェクトの完了度や品質スコアに基づき、次のプロジェクトで使用するAIエージェントモデルやプロンプトを自動的に選択・最適化する機能を構想・実装する。
- **Adaptive RAG（適応的RAG）**: 過去の検索ログ（`RAG_EVALUATIONS.yaml`）を解析し、検索クエリ（キーワードマッチ、カテゴリブースト）の重み付け（ウェイト）を動的に調整する。
- **ナレッジグラフの構築**: `VAULT` 内のドキュメント間の参照関係（ファイルAがファイルBをインポートしているなど）を解析し、ナレッジグラフとして構造化し、より高度な検索や関係性の理解を可能にする。
- **量子思考プロセス（Quantum Thinking）**: 複数の可能性を同時に探索・検証するような、高度な思考プロセスをサポートする機能を構想する。
- **マルチモーダルAIの連携**: テキスト生成、画像生成、音声生成など、異なるモーダルを持つ複数のAIモデルを1つのワークフロー内で連携させる機能を拡張する。

- **フィードバックループの自動化**: AIからのフィードバック（コードレビュー結果、実行結果）を解析し、`Tool-KB`やプロンプトに自動的に反映するループをより高度に自動化する。

**できないこと**:
- **一般的な人工知能（AGI）の実装**: VIBE OneBoxは、特定の目的（バイブコーディング・プロジェクト管理）に特化されたツールであり、汎用的なAGI（自律的な知的活動、汎用な推論など）を実現する機能やアーキテクチャは持たない。
- **エッジケースの自動生成**: 予期せぬバグやエッジケースを自動的に生成し、テストケースを作成する機能は持たない。

---

## まとめ

**VIBE OneBoxは、**「1フォルダ完結の自律進化型バイブコーディングOS」**を実現するための、極めて包括的かつ洗練されたツールセットです。**

上記にまとめた機能は、プロジェクトの開始からリリースまでを、**人間（意図決定）**と**AI（タスク実行）**の役割分担を明確にし、**品質（検証・ゲート）**と**知識（RAG・Tool-KB）**と**プロセス（ステートマシン）**と**運用（ログ・監査）**のすべてを網羅し、統合的に管理しています。

**このツールでできること**は、一言で言うと、
- **プロジェクトを「自律的な開発パイプライン」として回し**
- **AIに対して「世界最高峰のコンテキストとプロンプト」を提供し**
- **システム自体が「使うたびに育つ・進化していく」**
ことです。

**このツールの限界**は、
- **完全な自律化**: 最終的な意思決定は人間に委ねられている。
- **外部インフラの依存**: ベクトルDBや外部監査ツールは、システム外のリソースが必要である。

この「機能全リスト」を活用することで、VIBE OneBoxの真価である**「フォルダ運用の最大化（= AIと人間が協調し、最高品質の開発を最短時間で回せる）**を、さらに深く追求することができるでしょう。

### USER
RAG作成はできない？
フォルダ内のRAGの活用することが機能になってる？
Cursorは使わない　アンチグラビティかClaudコードを使います。

### ASSISTANT
その通り、重要なご指摘ありがとうございます。
おっしゃるご認識の通り、「**RAG作成（VAULTからkb_items.jsonlを生成する）**」や「**外部ベクトルDB（ChromaDBなど）を自動でセットアップする」」機能は、VIBE OneBox のような PowerShell スクリプトベースの環境（外部ツール依存ゼロ）単体では実現不可能です。

ただし、
- **「Cursorのみ」「Claudeのみ」** という制約下でも、
- 「VIBEフォルダの価値を最大化する（＝RAGを効果的に使う）」**
という観点からは、**「やるべきこと」はあります。**

以下に、
1. RAG関連の「できること」と「できないこと（代替案）」
2. エージェント環境（Cursor/Claude）向けの「できること（ローカルRAGの活用）」
3. Web UI化による「できること」
4. 総合的なアドバイス
の順で整理します。

---

## 1. RAG関連：できること・代替案

### 1-1. 「できないこと」の整理

残念ながら、以下の機能は外部ツールなしでは実現不可能です。

| 機能 | 状態 | 理由 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **外部ベクトルDBの自動構築** | ❌ 不可 | DockerコンテナやPython環境のセットアップが必要。VIBEはOS環境に依存しない設計です。 |
| **kb_items.jsonlの自動Embedding** | ❌ 不可 | OpenAI/AnthropicのEmbedding APIやローカルLLMが必要。PowerShell単体では現実的では困難です。 |
| **高度なRAG機能（Re-ranking, Hybrid Search）** | ❌ 不可 | 検索ロジックや重み付けの実装にはPythonなどの高度なスクリプト環境が必要です。 |

### 1-2. RAGの「やるべきこと（できること）」

外部ツールに頼らず、**VIBE環境だけでできるRAG活用の最大化**は次の通りです。

#### A. VAULT構造の徹底整備（手動でも良いので！）
外部DBが使えないなら、**「検索しやすいディレクトリ構造」**が最重要です。

- **やるべきこと**:
  - VAULT/以下をカテゴリ別に分類する
    - 例: `VAULT/OPS_OS/`, `VAULT/Snippets/`, `VAULT/Lessons/`
  - Markdownの見出し（`##`, `###`）を統一して、検索（grepなど）しやすくする
  - ファイル名にキーワードを含める（例: `governance_naming_rule.md`）
- **理由**: `generate_focuspack.ps1` がキーワードでファイルを検索しているため、人間が見ても予測がつきやすくなります。

#### B. `kb_items.jsonl` の「軽量化・メタデータ充実」
Embedding APIが使えない場合でも、JSON構造は整えておくべきです。

- **やるべきこと**:
  - `kb_items.jsonl` は以下のフィールドのみを持つ「軽量JSON」にする
    - `id` (sha256)
    - `title` (短いタイトル)
    - `category` (OPS/VIBE_CTRL/TEMPLATES/LESSONS)
    - `tags` (governance, onebox, naming) など
    - `source_path`
    - `created_at`
  - `content` は、元のドキュメント全体ではなく「要約」や「見出し」程度に留めるか、あるいは必要に応じて後で読む。
- **理由**: JSONファイルが重くなると、ロード時間が長くなり、Antigravity/Claudeのトークン制限を圧迫するためです。

#### C. 「ハイブリッドな検索」の手動化
高度な検索エンジンが使えないなら、「ハイブリッドな検索ルール」を人間が確立させます。

- **やるべきこと**:
  - `VAULT/INDEX.md` を作り、各ドキュメントの「概要」「キーワード」「関連ファイル」を記述する。
  - ユーザー（またはAI）が質問したとき、
    1. まず `VAULT/INDEX.md` で概要を確認
    2. キーワードから該当しそうなファイルを特定
    3. そのファイルを開く
  というフローをドキュメント（READMEやQUICK_START）に明記する。
- **理由**: AIは「関連ファイルを開く」指示（`open file://...`）に従うため、INDEXさえあればファイルパスを特定する精度が劇的に上がります。

---

## 2. エージェント環境（Cursor/Claude）向けの「できること」

外部RAGサーバーが使えない場合でも、AIエージェント側で「**ローカルRAG（手動検索）を活用する**」ことはできます。

### 2-1. Cursor（コードベースAI）の場合

Cursorは**「ファイルパスを参照する」「プロジェクトのフォルダ構造を深く理解する」**ことに非常に長けています。

- **やるべきこと（Cursor向け設定）**:
  - `.cursorrules` の作成:
    ```json
    {
      "Global rules": {
        "When generating code, always prioritize readability and maintain existing folder structure.",
        "Prefer using standard naming conventions: kebab-case for files."
      },
      "File targeting": {
        "For VIBE projects, always reference files in CORE/ and 04_RAG_FOCUS/ before writing new code."
      }
    }
    ```
  - `.cursorignore` の最適化:
    ```
    # 依存関係のない大容量ファイル
    node_modules/
    .git/
    # TRACE/VAULT は基本投入しない
    TRACE/
    VAULT/
    # 過去のプロジェクト（02_WORK/）は必要に応じて
    PROJECTS/20250101_previous_project/02_WORK/
    ```
  - **「ワークスペースのルート（VIBEフォルダ）」に `README_VIBE_FOR_CURSOR.md` を置く:
    ```markdown
    # VIBE Project Structure for Cursor
    This project follows the VIBE OneBox standard.
    
    - CORE: System brain and initial context.
    - 04_RAG_FOCUS: Project-specific knowledge base.
    - 01_HANDOFF: Task definitions.
    
    Key files to understand:
    - PROJECT.yaml: Project definition and phase.
    - STATUS.md: Current phase and next action.
    - VAULT/INDEX.md: Global knowledge index.
    ```
  - **理由**: `.cursorrules` はプロンプトとして機能するため、強い指示が書けます。`.cursorignore` でコンテキストを絞ることで、精度が上がります。

### 2-2. Claude（対話・思考型AI）の場合

Claudeは**「プロジェクト全体の文脈を理解する」**ことに優れています。

- **やるべきこと（Claude向け設定）**:
  - `.anthropic/project_settings.json` (もしあれば) の活用:
    ```json
    {
      "context_files": [
        "VIBE_CTRL/AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md",
        "VIBE_CTRL/AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md",
        "PROJECT.yaml",
        "STATUS.md",
        "04_RAG_FOCUS/FOCUS_MANIFEST.json"
      ],
      "custom_instructions": "Always respect the VIBE OneBox process defined in autonomous_flow.yaml."
    }
    ```
  - **プロジェクトの「トップダウン」**:
    - Claudeに対しては、`00_SPEC/spec.md` を最初に読ませるのが良いでしょう。
    - 次に `01_HANDOFF/handoff.md`、そして必要なら `VAULT/...` を読ませる。
  - この順序を `AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md` に記載しておくことで、Claudeが思考プロセス（Chain of Thought）をスムーズに組めやすくなります。
  - **理由**: Claudeは長いコンテキストを処理し、重要な情報を早めに見つける必要があります。

---

## 3. Web UI化：「できないこと」の解決

外部ベクトルDBが作れないのであれば、**「検索のハードルを下げるUI」**は有効な代替案です。

### 3-1. 「簡易なファイル一覧と検索UI」

- **やるべきこと**:
  - `web_ui.ps1` の機能を強化:
    - `VAULT/` のフォルダツリー表示
    - `KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` のテーブル形式表示（ID, タイトル, カテゴリ）
    - `grep` などの検索ボックス
  - **「選択したファイルを Clipboard にコピー」** ボタンを設ける。
  - または、**「選択したファイルを Cursor で開く」** ボタン（`cursor://file/C:/path/to/file`）を実装する。
- **理由**: Antigravity や Claude にファイルを渡すには、**「ファイルパスを取得する」**必要があるため、Web UI からパスをコピーさせれば、コピペ作業がゼロになります。

### 3-2. 「Markdownのプレビュー機能」

- **やるべきこと**:
  - Web UI に簡易な Markdown レンダラー（Marked など）を組み込む。
  - `VAULT/` 以下のファイルを選択して右ペインでプレビュー。
  - あるいは `kb_items.jsonl` の `content` をその場で表示。
- **理由**: ファイルを開く前に中身を確認したい場面（例: 「このドキュメントはプロンプト生成に使えるか？」）で劇的に役立ちます。

---

## 4. 総合的なアドバイス：今のVIBEでやるべきこと

外部RAGサーバーなどの導入は中長期的な施策なので、**今のVIBE OneBoxでできる範囲で最大化する**ためには、以下のアドバイスが有効です。

1.  **「VAULT構造の整備」を最優先する**
    - 現状の「適当にファイルを放り込んでいる」状態から脱却するために、カテゴライズ（分類）と `VAULT/INDEX.md` の作成を、明日の作業として行うことを推奨します。

2.  **「Cursor用ルール・Claude用マニュアル」を整理する**
    - 上記の `.cursorrules` や README の内容を、`OPS_OS/` 以下のマニュアルファイルとしてまとめます。例: `OPS_OS/20_AGENT_GUIDE_cursor.md`, `OPS_OS/21_AGENT_GUIDE_claude.md`。
    - これにより、エージェントごとの最適な使い方が明確になります。

3.  **「簡易なWeb UI」の導入を検討する**
    - 最初からフル機能を狙わず、`System.Net.HttpListener` を使った **「検索・プレビュー・パスコピー」に特化したもの**から始めることを検討します。
    - 基本的な機能だけであれば、非エンジニアも「ファイルを探してコピペする」手間が大幅に削減されます。

4.  **「kb_items.jsonl」の軽量化**
    - 現状の `kb_items.jsonl` が重い場合、`content` を削除（あるいは要約のみにする）スクリプトを走らせます。
    - これにより、Antigravity/Claude へのアップロードや処理時間が短縮されます。

---

## まとめ

- **「RAG作成（kb_items.jsonl生成や外部DB構築）」は、現状のVIBE環境単体では実現できません。  
- しかし、「VAULTのディレクトリ構造化」「kb_items.jsonlの軽量化」「Web UIでの検索サポート」は、外部ツールなしでも可能です。  
- また、「Antigravity」「Claude」「Cursor」といったAIエージェントごとに最適化されたルール・プロンプト・コンテキスト構造（`.cursorrules`, `.anthropic/project_settings.json`, `VAULT/INDEX.md`）を用意することで、**「RAGを使う体験」を最大化することができます。**

まずは、手動で可能な範囲（**VAULT構造の整備**と****エージェント向け設定ファイルの作成**）から着手し、その効果を確認しながら、次のステップ（Web UIや外部ツールの導入検討）を検討することをお勧めします。

## 1. 基盤・ステート管理の再定義

ここでは、システムの安全性（Safety）と運用の効率性（Efficiency）を左右する「基盤」を、技術的深掘りを行います。

### 1-1. run_verify.ps1 のスコープ問題解決（CRITICAL）

**深掘りポイント**:
`run_verify.ps1` 内の `$gates` 変数が、関数スコープで定義されている場合、`Add-Gate` 関数内で配列に要素を追加しても、呼び出し元のスコープ（スクリプトのルートレベル）には反映されません。これが、`Assert-StepReady` などでゲートを走査した際に「定義されていない」と判定される根本原因です。

**解決策**:
スクリプトスコープ変数を明示的に使用し、グローバル配列として扱います。

**実装コード**:
```powershell
# VIBE_CTRL/scripts/_bootstrap.ps1
# グローバルスコープ変数の定義
$script:gates = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()

function Add-Gate {
    param(
        [string]$Id,
        [string]$Name,
        [scriptblock]$Test,
        [string]$Severity = "ERROR"
    )
    # グローバル配列に追加するため、[void]キャストまたは直接代入を行う
    $null = $script:gates.Add([PSCustomObject]@{
        id       = $Id
        name     = $Name
        test     = $Test
        severity = $Severity
        result   = $null
        message  = ""
    }>)
}

# 使用例
Add-Gate -Id "G_PROJECT_YAML_EXISTS" -Name "PROJECT.yaml の存在" -Test { Test-Path "PROJECTS/*/PROJECT.yaml" }
```

**解決のメリット**:
すべてのゲートが同一の配列オブジェクトを参照するため、スコープの一貫性が保証されます。これにより、関数内で追加しても、ループで回収した結果を確実に評価できます。

---

### 1-2. 状態遷移ロジックの完全実装

**深掘りポイント**:
`autonomous_flow.yaml` は単なる設定ファイルではなく、状態遷移機械（State Machine）として機能する必要があります。具体的には、「現在の状態」に基づいて「次の状態」「次に実行すべきアクション」「次に実行すべきスクリプト」の3つを決定し、条件分岐を可能にする必要があります。

**実装仕様**:
状態 (`states`) ごとに、以下の要素を定義します。

1.  **`next`**:
    *   次に遷移する状態名（例: `spec` -> `wallbounce`）。
2.  **`action`**:
    *   次の状態へ遷移するためにユーザー（またはエージェント）が実行すべきコマンドまたはスクリプト（例: `RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE`）。
3.  **`preconditions`**:
    *   この状態に遷移するために満たすべき条件のリスト（例: `steps.spec_done == true`）。
4.  **`message`**:
    *   次の状態へ遷移する際、`STATUS.md` やコンソールに表示すべきメッセージ（例: "壁打ちで仕様の抜けを潰します"）。

**実装コード (autonomous_flow.yaml)**:
```yaml
flow_version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2025-12-28"

states:
  init:
    next: "spec"
    action: "RUN_WIZARD"
    message: "まず PROJECT.yaml を作成し、初期設定を行います"

  spec:
    next: "wallbounce"
    action: "RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.spec_done == true"
    message: "仕様が確定したので、壁打ちフェーズへ進みます"

  wallbounce:
    next: "focuspack"
    action: "RUN_3_FOCUSPACK"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.wallbounce_done == true"
    message: "壁打ちの結果を踏まえ、案件専用の知識パックを構築します"

  focuspack:
    next: "handoff"
    action: "RUN_4_HANDOFF"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.focuspack_done == true"
    message: "ハンドオフ用のドキュメントを生成します"

  handoff:
    next: "verify"
    action: "RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.handoff_done == true"
    message: "生成されたタスク定義に基づき、実装と検証を行います"

  verify:
    next: "lessons"
    action: "RUN_6_LESSONS"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.verify_done == true"
    message: "検証結果を分析し、改善点をナレッジベースに反映します"
```

**update_status.ps1 との連携**:
`autonomous_flow.yaml` で定義された内容を読み込み、`onebox_state.json` の現在状態を確認し、`autonomous_flow.yaml` の `preconditions` を満たしているかを判定します。条件を満たしている場合、`STATUS.md` の「次のアクション」欄を更新します。

---

## 2. RAG・KBエンジンの最適化

ここでは、AIエージェントに高品質なコンテキストを提供するための、RAG（検索拡張生成）およびKB（ナレッジベース）のアーキテクチャと運用フローを深掘りします。

### 2-1. kb_items.jsonl のデータ構造定義

**深掘りポイント**:
RAGシステムの性能は、チャンク（Chunk）の品質とメタデータ（Metadata）の精度に依存します。不適切なチャンク分割は検索精度（Recall）を低下させ、不十分なメタデータはフィルタリングの効率を下げます。

**データ構造定義**:
`KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` の各エントリ（行）は、以下のJSON構造を持つ必要があります。

1.  **`id`**:
    *   **型**: `string` (SHA-256ハッシュ値)
    *   **目的**: チャンクの一意識（Unique Identifier）。コンテンツの重複排除（Deduplication）を効率的に行うために不可欠です。
2.  **`title`**:
    *   **型**: `string`
    *   **目的**: チャンクの簡潔なタイトル。検索結果の一覧表示などで使用します。
3.  **`category`**:
    *   **型**: `string`
    *   **目的**: チャンクの所属カテゴリ（例: `OPS/VIBE_CTRL`, `TEMPLATES`, `LESSONS`）。検索時にカテゴリでフィルタリング（例: ドキュメントのみ検索）を行うために使用します。
4.  **`source_path`**:
    *   **型**: `string`
    *   **目的**: チャンクの元ファイルのパス（例: `OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md`）。出典の明示や、検索結果のリンク作成に使用します。
5.  **`section`**:
    *   **型**: `string`
    *   **目的**: 元ファイル内のセクション名（例: `## 概要`）。検索結果のコンテキストプレビューなどで使用します。
6.  **`content`**:
    *   **型**: `string`
    *   **目的**: チャンクの本文そのもの。AIへのコンテキスト注入（Context Injection）に使用します。
7.  **`tags`**:
    *   **型**: `array of strings`
    *   **目的**: チャンクの検索を助けるキーワード（例: `["governance", "naming", "verify"]`）。セマンティック検索や関連度スコアリングの向上に使用します。
8.  **`created_at`**, `updated_at`**:
    *   **型**: `string` (ISO 8601形式)
    *   **目的**: チャンクの作成日時と更新日時。鮮度の高い情報を優先的に表示するために使用します。

**実装上の注意点**:
*   JSON Lines形式（`kb_items.jsonl`）を採用し、巨大なファイルでもストリーミング読み込み可能にします。
*   `id` にはチャンク内容のSHA-256ハッシュを使用し、コンテンツが完全に同一であれば同じIDが割り当てられるようにします。

---

### 2-2. Focus Pack生成の効率化

**深掘りポイント**:
Focus Pack（`04_RAG_FOCUS/`）の生成は、Vault（`VAULT/`）からの関連情報抽出プロセスです。手動での関連度判断やファイルコピーは非効率であり、かつ人為的ミス（関連性の低いファイルの混入）を引き起こす可能性があります。

**プロセスの自動化**:
1.  **キーワード抽出**:
    *   `PROJECT.yaml` からプロジェクト名、領域（`areas`）、種類（`kind`）を抽出します。
    *   `STATUS.md` から現在のフェーズや言及されているキーワードを抽出します。
2.  **スコアリング（Scoring）**:
    *   抽出されたキーワードと、Vault内のファイル名・タイトル・内容とのマッチングを行い、関連度スコアを計算します。
    *   マッチングの重み付け（例: ファイル名マッチ: +2点、タイトルマッチ: +5点）を行い、スコアを合算します。
3.  **上位N件の選択**:
    *   計算されたスコアで降順に並べ替え、トークン制限または設定された件数（Top N）のみを抽出します。
4.  **ファイルのコピー**:
    *   選出されたチャンク（`kb_items.jsonl`のエントリ）の元ファイルを、`04_RAG_FOCUS/` ディレクトリ以下にコピーします。
5.  **マニフェスト作成**:
    *   抽出したファイル情報（ファイル名、スコア、サイズなど）を `FOCUS_MANIFEST.json` に出力します。

**スクリプト構成イメージ (generate_focuspack.ps1)**:
```powershell
# スコアリング用の重み定義
$keywordWeight = 2
$titleWeight = 5
$contentWeight = 1

function Get-ChunkScore {
    param(
        [string]$FilePath,
        [string[]]$Keywords
    )
    $fileName = Split-Path $FilePath -LeafBase
    $fileTitle = Get-Content $FilePath | Select-Object -First 1
    $fileContent = Get-Content $FilePath -Raw

    $score = 0
    foreach ($kw in $Keywords) {
        if ($fileName -like "*$kw*") { $score += $keywordWeight }
        if ($fileTitle -like "*$kw*") { $score += $titleWeight }
        if ($fileContent -like "*$kw*") { $score += $contentWeight }
    }
    return $score
}

# メイン処理
$project = Get-ProjectYaml
$status = Get-StatusMd
$keywords = @($project.name) + @($project.areas) + @($status.mentions)

$kbItems = Get-KbItems  # kb_items.jsonl の読み込み
$scoredItems = $kbItems | ForEach-Object {
    $score = Get-ChunkScore -FilePath $_.source_path -Keywords $keywords
    return [PSCustomObject]@{
        Item = $_
        Score = $score
    }
}

# スコア順にソートし、上位30件を選択
$topNItems = $scoredItems | Sort-Object -Property Score -Descending | Select-Object -First 30

# 04_RAG_FOCUS/ へのコピーとマニフェスト作成
$focusDir = Join-Path $projectPath "04_RAG_FOCUS"
if (-not (Test-Path $focusDir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $focusDir | Out-Null }

$manifest = @{
    ProjectName = $project.name
    GeneratedAt = Get-Date -Format "o"
    TotalCount = $topNItems.Count
    Items = @()
}

foreach ($item in $topNItems) {
    $destFile = Join-Path $focusDir ($item.id + ".json")
    Copy-Item -Path $item.source_path -Destination $destFile
    $manifest.Items += @{
        Id = $item.id
        Title = $item.title
        SourcePath = $item.source_path
        Score = $item.Score
    }
}

$manifest | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 | Out-File (Join-Path $focusDir "FOCUS_MANIFEST.json") -Encoding UTF8
```

---

### 2-3. 重複排除（Deduplication）の実装

**深掘りポイント**:
同一の情報が重複して登録されていると、検索精度の低下（重複したアイテムが何度も表示される）や、トークン効率の悪化（無駄なチャンクがコンテキストウィンドウを圧迫する）を招きます。

**アルゴリズム**:
コンテンツのSHA-256ハッシュを計算し、このハッシュ値を一意識子（`id`）として扱います。同じハッシュ値を持つエントリが複数存在する場合、最新の作成日時（または更新日時）が新しいものを「正（Master）」とし、それ以外を重複（Duplicate）として削除、またはマージします。

**実装ロジック (dedupe_kb.ps1)**:
1.  `kb_items.jsonl` をすべて読み込み、ハッシュ値をキーにしたハッシュテーブル（Dictionary）を作成します。
2.  同一ハッシュ値を持つエントリをグループ化します。
3.  各グループ内で、作成日時（`created_at`）または更新日時（`updated_at`）が最新であるエントリを「代表エントリ」とします。
4.  代表エントリ以外のエントリを削除対象とします。
5.  削除対象のエントリを`kb_items.jsonl`から削除します。
6.  重複排除のレポート（例: `KB_DEDUP_REPORT.md`）を出力します。

## 3. AIエージェント連携の高度化

ここでは、Antigravity, Claude, Cursorといった外部AIエージェントに、VIBE OneBoxの構造化された知識（CORE Pack, Focus Pack）を最適な形で提供するためのインターフェース（Packaging）を深掘りします。

### 3-1. CORE Packの定義と役割

**深掘りポイント**:
AIエージェントは、膨大なプロジェクトドキュメントをそのまま読み込むと、トークン制限を超過したり、重要な設定を見落としたりするリスクがあります。CORE Packは、AIに最初に提供すべき「必須かつ最小限の情報（System Brain）」を定義します。

**CORE Packの構成要素**:
1.  **システム定義**:
    *   `VIBE_CTRL/START_HERE.md`: システム全体の概要と開始手順。
    *   `VIBE_CTRL/CHEATSHEET.md`: よく使うコマンドやショートカットのリスト。
2.  **ルール・ガバナンス**:
    *   `OPS_OS/01_QUICK_START.md`: クイックスタートガイド。
    *   `OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md`: フォルダ構造と命名規則。
    *   `OPS_OS/11_FOLDER_GOVERNANCE.md`: フォルダ編集権限と運用ルール。
3.  **状態管理**:
    *   `STATUS.md`: プロジェクトの現在の状態と次のアクション。
    *   `onebox_state.json`: スクリプト用の実行状態管理。
4.  **軽量KBインデックス**:
    *   `KB/AI_READY/KB_INDEX.md`: ナレッジの全体目次。
    *   `KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl`: 検索用の構造化チャンクデータ。

**役割**:
*   AIとの対話開始直後に、まずCORE Packを読み込ませることで、システム全体の文脈と基本ルールを理解させます。
*   `KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` は、CORE Packのインデックスとして機能し、詳細な情報へのアクセスポイント（Pointer）となります。

---

### 3-2. Focus Packの自動生成と最適化

**深掘りポイント**:
Focus Pack（`04_RAG_FOCUS/`）は、プロジェクトごとのカスタマイズされたKBです。Vault全体からAIにそのまま提供するのは非効率であり、プロジェクトの文脈（仕様、目的、領域）に合わせた情報のみを提供することで、トークン効率と検索精度を最大化します。

**generate_toolpack.ps1 による自動化**:
`generate_toolpack.ps1` は、各ツール（Antigravity, Claude, Cursor）ごとに最適化されたパッケージ（Tool Pack）を生成するスクリプトです。Focus Packの内容（`04_RAG_FOCUS/`）をベースに、ツール固有の設定（プロンプト、トークン制限、無視ファイルリスト）を適用し、パッケージを生成します。

**ツールパックの構造**:
1.  **`PACK_MANIFEST.yaml`**:
    *   パッケージのメタデータ（ツール名、バージョン、作成日時）。
    *   含まれるファイルのリスト（CORE, Focus, Tool-Specific）。
    *   トークン上限（`max_tokens`）。
2.  **`README.md`**:
    *   ツールごとの使用上の注意点や制約事項。
3.  **`prompts/`**:
    *   ツール固有のプロンプト調整ファイル（例: `PT_ANTIGRAVITY.md`, `PT_CLAUDE.md`）。

---

## 4. 学習・進化ループの実装

ここでは、プロジェクトで得られた知見（Lesson）を組織的な資産（Tool-KB）として蓄積・活用し、システム全体を進化させるためのプロセス（Evolution Loop）を深掘りします。

### 4-1. LESSONフォーマットの構造化

**深掘りポイント**:
フリーフォーマットでの記述（WHAT, WHY, HOW）は、人間が読みやすくするためには十分ですが、スクリプトによる自動処理（Tool-KBへのマージなど）や、メトリクス（KPI）の集計を行うためには、より構造化された形式が必要です。

**構造化されたフォーマット例**:
```markdown
---
lesson_id: "L-20250128-001"
project:
  name: "example-api"
  phase: "verify"
  category: "governance"
occurred_at: "2025-01-28T12:00:00+09:00"

metrics:
  verify_fail_count: 3
  rework_count: 1
  human_score: 4

related_gates:
  - "G_NAMING_FILES"
  - "G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB"

tags:
  - "naming"
  - "path"
  - "governance"
---

# LESSON: ファイル名命名規則の逸脱

## WHAT（何が起きたか）
02_WORK/ 以下のソースコードで、`kebab-case` ではなく `snake_case` のファイル名が複数見つかり、`run_verify.ps1` の `G_NAMING_FILES` ゲートが FAIL した。

## WHY（なぜそうなったか）
1. プロジェクト初期の `00_SPEC/spec.md` に命名規則の明記がなかった。
2. 開発メンバーが過去の別プロジェクトの慣習（snake_case）をそのまま使ってしまった。

## HOW（どう対応したか）
1. すべての該当ファイル名をリネームした。
2. `01_HANDOFF/handoff.md` に「ファイル名は `kebab-case` に統一すること」を明記した。
3. 過去プロジェクトの命名ガイドラインを `VAULT/Tool-KB.md` に追加した。

## Tool-KB への反映
追加先セクション: `VAULT/Tool-KB.md` の「命名規則」セクション
内容:
- 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名は `kebab-case` に統一すること。
- フロントエンド/バックエンド共通（`Frontend/`, `Backend/`）を意識する。

## プロンプトへのフィードバック
対象プロンプト: `P30_BUILD_HANDOFF`
改善案:
- `handoff.md` テンプレに必ず「命名規則」セクションを含める指示を追加する。
- バージョン: 1.2 -> 1.3 (案)
```

**メリット**:
*   YAMLフロントマターにより、スクリプト（`sync_tool_kb.ps1`）が「Tool-KBへの反映」内容を正規表現（Regexなど）で抽出しやすくなります。
*   `metrics` フィールドを導入することで、どのレッスンが効果的だったかを定量的に評価・追跡可能になります。

---

### 4-2. sync_tool_kb.ps1 によるTool-KBの自動更新

**深掘りポイント**:
個々のプロジェクトで記録されたレッスンを、人間が `VAULT/Tool-KB.md` に手動で転記するのは非効率であり、転記漏れやフォーマットの不統一を招きます。`sync_tool_kb.ps1` は、このプロセスを自動化し、システム全体の知見レベルを底上げます。

**処理フロー**:
1.  `Outputs/LESSONS/` ディレクトリ以下にあるすべてのレッスンファイル（`LESSON_*.md`）を走査します。
2.  各レッスンファイルを読み込み、YAMLフロントマター部分を解析します。
3.  「Tool-KBへの反映」セクションの内容（追記すべき知見やルール）を抽出します。
4.  抽出した内容を、`VAULT/Tool-KB.md` の適切なセクション（例: 命名規則、コーディング規約）の末尾に追記します。
5.  最後に、変更した `VAULT/Tool-KB.md` に基づき、`KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` を更新（チャンク化・追加）します。
6.  `KB_INDEX.md` を再生成し、変更内容を反映させます。

**実装上の注意点**:
*   既存のセクションに対する追記は、セクション内の既存の内容を上書きしない形（例: 新しいルールの追加）にします。
*   `VAULT/Tool-KB.md` の更新は、バックアップを作成してから行うことを推奨します（`$file.bak`）。

---

## 5. ガバナンス・安全性の徹底化

ここでは、システム運用上のリスク（例外処理、データ破損、セキュリティインシデント）を最小化するためのガバナンス（Governance）と安全性（Safety）に関する施策を深掘りします。

### 5-1. Waiver（免除）運用の徹底化

**深掘りポイント**:
ガバナンスの厳格さを保ちつつ、運用の柔軟性を確保するための仕組みです。しかし、漫然な使用はシステムの品質低下や監査不能を招くため、使用の記録（Audit Trail）と有効期限（Expiration）の管理が不可欠です。

**Waiverのデータ構造**:
`waivers/active/*.yaml` として以下の構造を持ちます。

**実装コード**:
```yaml
waiver_id: "W-20250128-001"
gate_id: "G_TOKEN_LIMIT_FOCUS_PACK"
reason: "初期プロジェクトの検証フェーズでの一時的なトークン制限緩和。プロトタイプ検証のため、一時的に上限を超過することを許可します。"
expires_at: "2025-02-04T23:59:59+09:00"
created_at: "2025-01-28T10:00:00+09:00"
created_by: "user1"
project:
  name: "example-api"
```

**フィールドの解説**:
*   `waiver_id`: 一意識子。
*   `gate_id`: この免除が関連するゲートID（例: `run_verify.ps1` で定義されているID）。
*   `reason`: 免除の理由。理由は具体的かつ最低文字数（例: 20文字以上）である必要があります。
*   `expires_at`: 免除の有効期限。ISO 8601形式。期限切れのWaiverは無効とみなされます。
*   `created_at`, `created_by`: 作成日時と作成者。監査証跡となります。

---

### 5-2. 危険操作の抑制と監査

**深掘りポイント**:
PowerShellスクリプトにおける `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` などの強制削除コマンドは、誤実行時の取り返しのないデータ破損（Data Loss）を招くリスクがあります。

**抑制策**:
1.  **関数レベルでの禁止**:
    *   スクリプト内で直接 `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` を呼び出す関数を作成しないようにします。削除が必要な処理は、専用の関数（例: `Invoke-SafeRemove`）を経由させるべきです。
2.  **`-WhatIf` パラメータの強制**:
    *   削除や上書きを行う関数に、`-WhatIf` スイッチを必須パラメータとして追加します。これにより、コマンド実行時に「何が行われるか」をシミュレート（ドライラン）させ、ユーザーに確認を求めます。
3.  **対話形式の確認**:
    *   可能な限り、`Read-Host` コマンドレット（AsPsecureString）を用い、`"Y"`（Yes） or `"N"`（No）での確認を行い、明示的な意図確認を求めます。

**実装コード例**:
```powershell
function Remove-Safely {
    param(
        [string]$Path,
        [switch]$Force
    )

    if (-not $Force) {
        $confirmation = Read-Host "パス '$Path' を削除します。よろしいですか？ (Y/N)"
        if ($confirmation -ne "Y") {
            Write-Host "操作はキャンセルされました。"
            return
        }
    }

    # -WhatIf が指定されている場合はドライランとして処理
    if ($Force) {
        Write-Host "[WhatIfモード] '$Path' を削除します。"
    } else {
        Remove-Item -Path $Path -Recurse -Force
    }
}
```

## 6. 外部AIエージェント連携の高度化

ここでは、Antigravity, Claude, Cursorといった外部AIエージェントとの連携において、それぞれの特性（Characteristics）を最大限に活用し、VIBE OneBoxの価値を最大化するための高度な設定と統合（Integration）を深掘りします。

### 6-1. Antigravity連携の最適化

**深掘りポイント**:
Antigravityは、Googleが提供するAgent-First IDEであり、「Mission Control」からの複数エージェントのオーケストレーションと、クロスサーフェス（エディタ、ターミナル、ブラウザ）での同期制御を特徴としています。VIBE OneBoxは、このAntigravityの機能（タスク管理、成果物の提示、検証結果の可視化）と、VIBEのステートマシン（`autonomous_flow.yaml`）とを組み合わせることで、シームレスな自律開発環境を実現します。

**統合ポイント**:
1.  **タスク定義の標準化**:
    *   VIBEの `RUN_*` コマンドを、Antigravityの「タスク（Task）」として定義します。
    *   タスクのタイトル、説明、期待される成果物（Artifact）を明記します。
2.  **成果物と検証結果の提示**:
    *   `run_verify.ps1` の出力（`VERIFY_LAST.md`）は、Antigravityの「成果物（Artifact）」として認識されます。
    *   検証に失敗したゲート（FAIL）の情報を、Antigravityの「修正タスク」として自動的にタスクリストに反映させることができます。
3.  **ルールとワークフローの適用**:
    *   Antigravityの「ルール（Rules）」および「ワークフロー（Workflows）」機能を活用し、特定のコマンド（例: `rm -rf`）の実行禁止や、特定の手順を踏むことの強制を行います。

---

### 6-2. Claude連携の最適化

**深掘りポイント**:
Claude（Anthropic製）は、長いコンテキストの処理や深い推論に優れています。VIBE OneBoxの構造化されたドキュメントをClaudeのコンテキストウィンドウ（200kトークン）に効率的に収めるためには、情報の優先順位付けや要約化が重要です。

**最適化策**:
1.  **トップダウン読み込みの強制**:
    *   Claudeには、まず `PROJECT.yaml` と `00_SPEC/spec.md`（トップダウン情報）を読み込ませ、プロジェクトの全体像とゴールを把握させるようにします。
2.  **Focus Packの段階的提供**:
    *   RAG検索の結果全てを一度に渡すのではなく、関連性の高いものから順に提供（Citations）することで、Claudeの推論の効率を上げます。
3.  **ツール固有の設定**:
    *   `.anthropic/project_settings.json` などを使用し、Claudeの動作（最大トークン、出力形式）をVIBEプロジェクトに合わせて調整します。

---

### 6-3. Cursor連携の最適化

**深掘りポイント**:
Cursorは、VS CodeベースのAIエディタであり、ファイルシステムへの深い統合と高速なコード補完が特徴です。VIBE OneBoxのフォルダ構造をCursorに認識させ、不要なファイル（`TRACE/`, `node_modules/`）を除外（Ignore）し、開発に必要なファイル（`02_WORK/`, `04_RAG_FOCUS/`）にフォーカスを当てることで、Cursorのパフォーマンスを最大化します。

**`.cursorignore` の設定**:
```
# VIBE OneBox用 Cursor Ignore設定

# 依存関係・一時ファイル
node_modules/
.git/
*.log
.DS_Store

# 巨大なログ・証跡（AIコンテキストとしては使用しない）
TRACE/
VAULT/

# 過去プロジェクト（必要に応じてコメントアウト）
# PROJECTS/20250101_previous_project/02_WORK/

# 生成物・一時ファイル
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

---

## 結論

本ドキュメントは、VIBE OneBoxシステムの全機能を、アーキテクチャ、プロセス、および外部AIエージェント連携という観点から深掘りし、その背後にある設計思想や実装上の課題、そして具体的な解決策とコード例を網羅しました。

**次のアクション**:
1.  **即時実施（Sクラス）**:
    *   `run_verify.ps1` のスコープ問題を修正し（`$script:gates`の導入）。
    *   `autonomous_flow.yaml` の仕様を固め、状態遷移ロジックを完全に実装する。
    *   `kb_items.jsonl` のデータ構造を定義し（SHA-256 ID, Tags等）。
2.  **中・長期的実施（Aクラス）**:
    *   `generate_focuspack.ps1` によるスコアリングロジックを実装し、Focus Pack生成の精度と効率を上げる。
    *   `dedupe_kb.ps1` を実装し、KBの重複排除を自動化する。
    *   Web UI（`web_ui.ps1`）を導入し、非エンジニアの参入障壁を下げる。
3.  **高度化（S+クラス）**:
    *   Antigravity, Claude, Cursor との連携設定（ルール、Ignore設定、ワークスペース定義）を最適化する。
    *   自己進化ループ（`sync_tool_kb.ps1`, プロンプト評価）を構築し、システムを自律的に進化させる。

この指示書に従い、VIBE OneBoxシステムの機能を網羅的かつ体系的に把握・実装することで、フォルダ運用の最大化（＝システムの進化とエージェントとの最適な統合）を実現できます。

---

## 1. 総論

### 1-1. 設計思想：なぜ「フォルダ＝OS」なのか
VIBE OneBoxは、単なるファイル置場ではなく、**「AIと人間が協調して開発を回すための、自律的に進化するオペレーティングシステム（OS）」**そのものです。

- **人間の役割**: `PROJECT.yaml` で「やりたいこと」を定義し、運用を指示する（Architect役）。
- **AIの役割**: CORE/Focus/Tool Pack という「コンテキスト」を与えられ、自律的にタスク（RUN_1〜7）を実行する（Executor役）。
- **システムの役割**: 状態（onebox_state.json）を管理し、ステートマシン（autonomous_flow.yaml）に従って「次の一手」を提示し、両者を迷いなくする。

### 1-2. 4つの構成要素
VIBE OneBoxは、以下の4つの要素が完全に統合されて初めて成立します。

1.  **プロセス (Process)**:
    - `RUN_1_SPEC` (仕様策定) → `RUN_7_RELEASE` (成果物凍結)
    - 「一本道」のフローを定義し、ステップスキップを物理的に防ぐ（Assert-StepReady）。

2.  **知識 (Knowledge)**:
    - VAULT（過去の全ナレッジ）→ kb_items.jsonl（構造化チャンク）→ Focus Pack（案件専用KB）→ Tool-KB（自己進化したツール知識）。
    - 「学んで賢くなる」ためのRAGパイプラインを構築します。

3.  **コンテキスト (Context)**:
    - CORE Pack（システム脳）→ Focus Pack（案件知識）→ Tool Pack（ツール最適化設定）。
    - AIがいつ、何を、どの順序で読むべきかを標準化します。

4.  **ガバナンス (Governance)**:
    - run_verify.ps1（品質ゲート）→ Waivers（免除運用）→ Logging（監査ログ）→ Security Scan（機密漏洩防止）。
    - 「壊れにくい環境」を作り、維持し続けます。

### 2-2. 3つの状態ファイル（ステートマシンの脳）

システムが自律的に動くため、以下の3つのファイルが「単一の真実」として機能します。

| ファイル名 | 役割 | 主な内容 | 管理スクリプト |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROJECT.yaml** | 人間・AI共通の真実 | プロジェクト定義、制約、ツール設定 | read_yaml.ps1, write_yaml.ps1 |
| **onebox_state.json** | AI・スクリプト用の実行状態 | 現在のフェーズ、ステップ完了フラグ、最終実行コマンド | run_all.ps1, update_status.ps1 |
| **autonomous_flow.yaml** | 状態遷移ルール定義 | 状態ごとの次の状態、アクション、前提条件 | Assert-StepReady |

---

## 3. プロセス・ステートマシン (Process & State Machine)

ここでは、「迷いをなくす」「自動的に次へ進める」ためのステートマシンの完全実装について深掘りします。

### 3-1. PROJECT.yaml：人間とAIの共通言語

**役割**: プロジェクトのゴール・種類・担当領域・制約を一元管理する。

```yaml
# PROJECT.yaml - 最重要設定ファイル
project:
  name: "example-api"
  short_name: "example-api"
  goal: "顧客向けAPI v1をリリースする"
  kind: "prototype"  # mvp / production / infra / docs

  phase: "init"  # init / spec / wallbounce / focuspack / handoff / verify / lessons / release

  areas:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra

  constraints:
    max_token_per_tool: 200_000
    paid_api_allowed: false
    allow_network_requests: false
    require_db_design: false
    require_docker: false

  tools:
    antigravity:
      enabled: true
      workspace_root: "WORKSPACE_ANTIGRAVITY"
    claude:
      enabled: true
    cursor:
      enabled: false
```

### 3-2. autonomous_flow.yaml：状態遷移の完全自動化

**役割**: 「今どの状態か」「次に何をすべきか」をプログラム的に定義します。

```yaml
# autonomous_flow.yaml - ステートマシン定義
states:
  init:
    next: "spec"
    action: "RUN_WIZARD → RUN_1_SPEC"
    message: "まず PROJECT.yaml を作成し、初期設定を行います"
    preconditions: []

  spec:
    next: "wallbounce"
    action: "RUN_2_WALLBOUNCE"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.spec_done == true"
    message: "壁打ちで仕様の抜け漏れを潰します"

  wallbounce:
    next: "focuspack"
    action: "RUN_3_FOCUSPACK"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.wallbounce_done == true"
    message: "Vaultから案件専用Focus Packを構築します"

  focuspack:
    next: "handoff"
    action: "RUN_4_HANDOFF"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.focuspack_done == true"
    message: "実装担当AIへのHandoffを生成します"

  handoff:
    next: "verify"
    action: "RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.handoff_done == true"
    message: "検証→修正のループを回します"

  verify:
    next_ok: "lessons"
    next_fail: "handoff"
    action: "RUN_5_VERIFYREPAIR （修正ループ）"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.verify_done == true"
    message_ok: "検証OK → 学び回収へ"
    message_fail: "検証NG → 修正・再検証"

  lessons:
    next: "release"
    action: "RUN_6_LESSONS"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.lessons_done == true"
    message: "学びを Tool-KB / プロンプト / ゲートに反映します"

  release:
    next: null
    action: "新規プロジェクト開始 OR RUN_STATUS"
    preconditions:
      - "steps.release_done == true"
    message: "プロジェクト一巡完了"
```

### 3-3. Assert-StepReady：ステップスキップの物理的禁止

**役割**: 各RUN_*スクリプトの冒頭で、前提ステップが完了しているかをチェックし、未完了ならエラーで停止します。

**擬似コード（PowerShell）**:
```powershell
function Assert-StepReady {
    param(
        [string]$CurrentStep,
        [hashtable]$State,
        [hashtable]$Flow
    )

    $expected = $Flow[$CurrentStep].preconditions
    if (-not $expected) { return }

    foreach ($cond in $expected) {
        if ($cond -match 'steps\.(?<key>\w+)\s*==\s*true') {
            $key = $Matches['key']
            if (-not $State.steps[$key]) {
                Write-Error "前提ステップ未完了: $key"
                Write-Host "次に実行すべきコマンド: $($Flow[$CurrentStep].action)"
                exit 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 4. RAG・知識管理 (RAG & Knowledge Base)

### 4-1. kb_items.jsonl：RAGの心臓部

**役割**: Vault内のドキュメントを、検索可能なチャンクとして構造化して管理します。

```json
{
  "id": "sha256:...",
  "title": "VIBE OneBox 標準フォルダ構成",
  "category": "OPS/ONEBOX_STANDARD",
  "source_path": "OPS_OS/03_ONEBOX_STANDARD.md",
  "section": "## フォルダ構成",
  "content": "VIBE OneBox は CORE...",
  "tags": ["onebox", "folder-standard", "governance"],
  "lang": "ja",
  "created_at": "2025-12-28T10:00:00+09:00",
  "updated_at": "2025-12-28T10:00:00+09:00",
  "length": 420
}
```

### 4-2. Focus Pack生成：Vaultから案件KBへ

**役割**: Vaultから、プロジェクトに関連するチャンクのみを抽出・スコアリングし、`04_RAG_FOCUS/` に最適化されたKBを提供します。

**ロジック（generate_focuspack.ps1）**:
1. `PROJECT.yaml` / `STATUS.md` からキーワード抽出。
2. `kb_items.jsonl` を読み込み。
3. キーワードマッチ（ファイル名+5点、内容+1点）でスコア計算。
4. スコア上位N件（例30件）を選択。
5. `04_RAG_FOCUS/` にチャンクファイルとしてコピー。
6. `FOCUS_MANIFEST.json`（どのファイルを使ったか、スコア）を生成。

### 4-3. 重複排除（Deduplication）：KBの信頼性向上

**役割**: 内容が同じチャンク（SHA256ハッシュ一致）が重複していないかをチェックし、整合性を保ちます。

**ロジック（dedupe_kb.ps1）**:
1. `kb_items.jsonl` を読み込み。
2. SHA256ハッシュをキーにしたハッシュテーブルを作成。
3. 重複するアイテムをグループ化。
4. 各グループの代表アイテム（最新更新日時のもの）を正（Master）とし、それ以外を削除（またはアーカイブへ移動）。

---

## 5. AIエージェント統合

### 5-1. 3つのパック層

AIがVIBEフォルダを効率的に使うため、コンテキストは3つの層に分けて提供されます。

| 層名 | 役割 | 含まれるファイル | 対象 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CORE Pack** | システム脳（初期コンテキスト） | AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md, AI_CONTEXT_STRUCTURE.md, AI_THINKING_PROTOCOL.md | 全AI |
| **Focus Pack** | 案件専用知識 | FOCUS_MANIFEST.json, kb_items_project.jsonl, PROJECT_KB.md | 実行中のAI |
| **Tool Pack** | ツール固有設定 | PACK_MANIFEST.yaml, prompts/, README.md | 特定ツール |

### 5-2. AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md：AIの「脳」の定義

**役割**: AIに対して「あなたは誰か」「何を目指すべきか」「どう振る舞うべきか」を定義します。

```markdown
# AI_SYSTEM_ROLE.md

あなたは VIBE OneBox に従属するシニアアーキテクト・エージェントです。

## 基本方針

- まず CORE Pack を全体を通読し、次に Focus Pack / Tool Pack を参照する。
- 不明な仕様や重要な判断が必要な場合は必ず WALLBOUNCE プロトコルに従い、人間に確認する。
- すべての設計・コード生成後に run_verify.ps1 の結果を参照し、FAIL しているゲートに対して修正案を提示する。

## ゴール

- 指定されたプロジェクトの仕様を、高品質かつ安全な実装に落とし込むこと。
- VIBE OneBox の運用ルールとガバナンスを守りつつ、スピードを最大化すること。
```

---

## 6. 自己進化ループ (Self-Improvement Loop)

### 6-1. Lessons → Tool-KB：ナレッジの育成

**役割**: プロジェクト終了後に、`06_LOGS/LESSONS/` に失敗や成功要因を記録し、ツール知識（Tool-KB）に反映させます。

```markdown
# LESSON テンプレート

---
lesson_id: "L-20251228-001"
project:
  name: "example-api"
  phase: "verify"

## WHAT（何が起きたか）
02_WORK/ 以下のソースコードで、kebab-case ではなく snake_case のファイル名が複数見つかり、run_verify.ps1 の G_NAMING_FILES ゲートが FAIL した。

## WHY（なぜそうなったか）
1. プロジェクト初期の spec.md に命名規則の明記がなかった。
2. 開発メンバーが過去の別プロジェクトの慣習をそのまま使ってしまった。

## HOW（どう対応したか）
1. すべての該当ファイル名をリネーム。
2. 01_HANDOFF/handoff.md に「命名規則：kebab-case」を明記。
3. 過去プロジェクトの命名ガイドラインを Tool-KB に追加。

## Tool-KB への反映
- 追加先セクション: VAULT/Tool-KB.md の「命名規則」セクション
- 内容:
  - 02_WORK/ 以下のファイル名は kebab-case に統一。
  - フロントエンド/バックエンド共通。
```

## 7. ガバナンス・安全性

### 7-1. Gates（品質ゲート）：S級品質の担保

**役割**: `run_verify.ps1` により、プロジェクトの品質やルール遵守状況を自動チェックします。

**主なゲート**:
- `G_PROJECT_YAML_EXISTS`: `PROJECT.yaml` が存在するか。
- `G_PAID_API_POLICY`: 有料API利用ポリシーが守られているか。
- `G_NAMING_PROJECT`: プロジェクトフォルダ名が `YYYYMMDD_<shortname>` 形式か。
- `G_NAMING_FILES`: ファイル名が命名規則（kebab-case等）に従っているか。
- `G_ABSOLUTE_PATH_IN_KB`: `kb_items.jsonl` に絶対パス（`C:/`）が混入していないか。
- `G_DUPLICATE_CHUNKS`: `kb_items.jsonl` 内に重複チャンクがないか。

**実装（擬似コード）**:
```powershell
# run_verify.ps1 - Gates定義例
$script:gates = [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new()

function Add-Gate {
    param([string]$Id, [string]$Name, [scriptblock]$Test)
    $gate = [PSCustomObject]@{
        id = $Id
        name = $Name
        test = $Test
        result = $null
        message = ""
    }
    $null = $script:gates.Add($gate)
}

# 使用例
Add-Gate -Id "G_PROJECT_YAML_EXISTS" -Name "PROJECT.yaml の存在" -Test {
    Test-Path "PROJECTS/*/PROJECT.yaml"
}

# 実行ループ
$gates | ForEach-Object {
    $gate.result = & $gate.test
    if ($gate.result -eq $false) {
        $gate.message = "FAIL: $($gate.Name) の条件を満たしていません"
    } else {
        $gate.message = "PASS"
    }
}
```

### 7-2. Waivers（免除）：例外的柔軟性

**役割**: 緊急や例外的な事態において、一時的にポリシー違反を許可する仕組みです。

**運用ルール**:
- `waivers/active/*.yaml` で定義。
- `create_waiver.ps1` で作成（理由の最低文字数制限あり）。
- `check_waivers.ps1` で有効期限切れや繰り返しを検知・警告。

---

## 8. 強化・高度化

### 8-1. Web UI：運用体験の劇的向上

**課題**: CLI（黒い画面）は、非エンジニアにとって参入障壁となっている。

**解決策**: `web_ui.ps1` を実装し、ブラウザからボタン一つで操作できるダッシュボードを提供します。

**機能**:
- 状態確認・「次の一手」表示。
- 実行ログのリアルタイム表示。
- ファイル一覧・検索UI。

### 8-2. Adaptive RAG：検索精度の自己進化

はい、承知いたしました。
「VIBE OneBoxシステムを操作するための、DEEPリサーチ用の深層的かつ網羅的な指示プロンプト」を作成する」ということですね。
これは、RAG構築や複雑な分析タスクにおいて、AI（LLM）の能力を引き出すために非常に有効なアプローチです。

以下に、ご要望に沿った**「DEEPリサーチ活用プロンプト（マニュアル）」**を作成します。

# 📘 VIBE OneBox: DEEP RAG 分析・構築ガイドブック (Deep RAG Analysis & Construction Guide)

## 概要

本ガイドブックは、VIBE OneBox環境におけるRAG（検索拡張生成）システムを高度化し、**「深層的でなかつ網羅的な分析・知識構築」**を行うための、DEEPリサーチ（Deep Research Server）と協調するための包括的な指示セットです。

このプロンプトは、AI（またはLLM）に対して以下を指示します。

1.  **現状分析**: VAULT内の知識を多角的に分析し、深層構造を特定する。
2.  **深層化**: 分析結果に基づき、チャンクに階層的・プロセス的・関係的なメタデータを付与する。
3.  **クエリ生成**: ユーザーの探索目的に応じた、多様な検索戦略を立案する。
4.  **ベクトル化・インデキシング**: 生成されたチャンクを検索可能な状態にする。
5.  **評価・フィードバック**: システム全体の精度を測定し、継続的に改善する。

---

## 前提条件

本プロンプトを使用する前に、以下の環境設定が整っていることを確認してください。

- **VAULTの構造化**: `VAULT/` ディレクトリ以下に、ドキュメントが整理（分類フォルダ、統一命名規則）されていること。
- **kb_items.jsonlの存在**: `KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl` が存在し、少なくとも1つのチャンク情報が含まれていること。
- **PowerShell環境**: 実行スクリプトを扱えるPowerShellバージョン（5.1以上）が使用可能であること。
- **Python環境（オプション）**: ベクトル計算や高度な処理を行う場合、Python環境がセットアップされていること。

---

## 手順 1: 現状分析

### 1-1. ランダムサンプリング
まず、VAULT内の全ドキュメントまたは代表的なサブセットからランダムにファイルをサンプリングし、全体像を把握します。

**指示内容**:
`VAULT/` ディレクトリ以下のドキュメントから、少なくとも50ファイル、あるいは特定のカテゴリフォルダ（例：`OPS_OS/`, `TEMPLATES/`）からランダムにサンプリングを行ってください。
サンプリングしたファイルのパスリストと、そのファイルの簡潔な概要（最初の3〜5行、または見出しレベルのH2見出し）を抽出してください。
この分析は、後の「深層化」プロセスの入力データとして使用されます。

**出力形式**:
```text
サンプリング対象ファイル:
- [ファイルパス1]
- [ファイルパス2]
...

簡潔な概要:
- [ファイルパス1]: [概要テキスト]
- [ファイルパス2]: [概要テキスト]
...
```

### 1-2. キーワード・カテゴリの初期抽出
サンプリングの結果に基づき、重要そうなキーワードやカテゴリを人手で、あるいはAIによる抽出・補完を行います。

**指示内容**:
前の手順で抽出された「簡潔な概要」を分析し、以下の情報をリストアップしてください。

1.  **主要キーワード (Top Keywords)**: ドキュメント全体を通じて頻繁に登場し、かつ重要そうなキーワード（名詞、固有名詞）を5〜10個抽出してください。
2.  **カテゴリ (Categories)**: ドキュメントの内容区分（例：技術仕様、手順、トラブルシューティング、アーキテクチャ、運用ポリシーなど）に基づき、適切なカテゴリ名（日本語）を3〜5個付与してください。
3.  **ドメイン・領域 (Domains)**: 関連する技術領域やビジネス領域（例：フロントエンド、バックエンド、インフラ、セキュリティ、データベース）を特定してください。

これらのメタデータは、後の「深層化」および「クエリ生成」プロセスにおいて重要な役割を果たします。

**出力形式**:
```yaml
初期メタデータ:
  主要キーワード:
    - "キーワード1"
    - "キーワード2"
    - ...
  カテゴリ:
    - "カテゴリ1"
    - "カテゴリ2"
    - ...
  ドメイン・領域:
    - "ドメイン1"
    - "ドメイン2"
    - ...
```

---

## 手順 2: 深層化

分析されたサンプルやキーワードに基づき、単なるテキストチャンクよりも、リッチな情報を持つチャンク（深層チャンク）を作成します。

### 2-1. 階層型チャンクの定義
単一の文書を、トピック階層（Topic Hierarchy）、プロセスフロー（Process Flow）、ドキュメント間リンク（Inter-document Links）などの観点から構造化します。

**指示内容**:
前の手順で特定されたドキュメント（またはサンプリングされたファイル）を対象に、以下の観点で深い分析を行い、その結果をチャンクとして定義してください。

1.  **トピック階層**:
   - ドキュメント全体を通る主要なトピック（例：アーキテクチャ概要、データモデル設計、API仕様、認証フローなど）を特定し、階層構造（ルートトピック > サブトピック > リーフトピック）を特定してください。
   - 各レベルのトピックには、簡潔な説明を付与してください（例：「データモデルの全体アーキテクチャ」「認証フローの各ステップ」）。

2.  **プロセスフロー**:
   - ドキュメントに記述されている手順やワークフロー（例：構築手順、設定手順、トラブルシューティング手順）を抽出し、前段 → 後段の順序関係を特定してください。
   - 手順間には、前提条件や依存関係を明記してください（例：「設定完了後に実施」）。

3.  **ドキュメント間リンク**:
   - ドキュメント内で参照されている他のドキュメント（例：「詳細は設定ガイドを参照してください」「関連するAPI仕様はXを参照してください」）を特定してください。
   - 可能であれば、リンクの種類（参照、関連、詳細）を分類してください。

**チャンク構造案**:
チャンクごとに、以下のJSON構造で情報を定義することを推奨します。

```json
{
  "chunk_id": "unique_id",
  "source_file": "ドキュメントファイルパス",
  "chunk_type": "deep_layer",
  "topics": {
    "root_topic": "ルートトピック名",
    "subtopics": ["サブトピック1", "サブトピック2"],
    "description": "トピックの簡潔な説明"
  },
  "process_flows": {
    "main_flow": "メインフローの説明",
    "steps": ["ステップ1", "ステップ2"]
  },
  "document_links": [
    {
      "target_file": "リンク先ファイルパス",
      "link_type": "reference",
      "description": "リンクの目的"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "content_summary": "チャンク内容の要約（100〜200文字程度）",
    "extraction_date": "作成日時",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### 2-2. 階層的メタデータの生成
深層チャンクの定義に加え、チャンク間の関係性や重要度を定義するメタデータを生成します。

**指示内容**:
定義された深層チャンク（トピック、プロセスなど）に対し、それらがどのように関連しているか、またドキュメント全体の中でどの程度重要なのかを示すメタデータを生成してください。

1.  **トピック関連度 (Topic Relatedness)**:
   - 同じルートトピックに属するチャンク間には、高い関連度（例：0.9）を付与してください。
   - 異なるルートトピックに属するチャンク間や、ドキュメント内で離れて位置にあるチャンク間には、中程度の関連度（例：0.5）を付与してください。
   - 関連性が低い、あるいは文脈的に独立しているチャンクには、低い関連度（例：0.1）を付与してください。

2.  **重要度 (Importance)**:
   - システム全体（VIBE OneBox）の運用や開発において中核となる情報（例：アーキテクチャ概要、主要な設定手順）を含むチャンクには、高い重要度（例：0.9）を付与してください。
   - 特定の領域に特化した情報であるが、それ以外にはあまり重要でない情報（例：特定のツールのトラブルシューティング手順）を含むチャンクには、中程度の重要度（例：0.5）を付与してください。
   - 補足的な情報や付帯的な情報を含むチャンクには、低い重要度（例：0.2）を付与してください。

3.  **依存関係 (Dependencies)**:
   - 他のチャンクの理解の前提となるチャンク（例：設定手順の完了）には、高い依存スコア（例：0.8）を付与してください。
   - 比較的独立しているが、他のチャンクの理解に大きく依存しないチャンクには、低い依存スコア（例：0.2）を付与してください。

**メタデータ出力形式**:
上記の定義に基づき、各深層チャンクに対して以下のメタデータを生成してください。

```yaml
メタデータ付与:
  chunk_id: "対象のチャンクID"
  relationships:
    related_to: ["関連チャンクID1", "関連チャンクID2"]
    related_from: ["前提チャンクID"]
    importance: 0.9
    dependency_score: 0.7
```

## 手順 3: クエリ生成

ユーザーの質問意図や文脈を推論し、単一の検索キーワードでは見落としがちな多角的な検索戦略を生成させます。

### 3-1. 推論とクエリ拡張
ユーザーが質問した場合、その質問を多角的に解釈し、元の質問に加えて、より広範囲な情報網をカバーするような検索クエリのセットを生成してください。

**指示内容**:
以下のユーザー質問の例に対し、それをどのように拡張・多角化すべきかを具体的に示してください。

**出力形式**:
各例に対して、生成された拡張クエリをリストアップしてください。

```yaml
クエリセット:
  元質問: "ユーザーの元質問"
  推論: "ユーザーの意図・背景の解釈"
  拡張クエリ:
    - "拡張クエリ1"
    - "拡張クエリ2"
    - ...
```

### 3-2. セマンティッククエリの生成
文脈的な類似性を捉えるための、セマンティククエリ（ベクトル検索など）を生成します。

**指示内容**:
前の手順で特定されたキーワードやカテゴリに基づき、以下のルールに従ってセマンティククエリを生成してください。

1.  **類義語・上位語の抽出**:
   - 指定されたキーワードの類義語（上位語・下位語）や、その関連する上位語（例：「実装」の類義語として「開発」「構築」「設定」「デプロイ」など）を抽出してください。

2.  **技術用語の変形**:
   - 技術用語を活用形（例：「実装された」「設定する」「検証する」）や名詞形（例：「実装」「設定」「検証」）に変形させたクエリを生成してください。

3.  **否定・除外クエリの生成**:
   - 特定の条件を満たさない情報を除外するための、否定形のクエリ（例：「〜ではない」「〜を含まない」「〜に関連しない」）を生成してください。

---

## 手順 4: ベクトル化・インデキシング

生成された深層チャンクおよびメタデータを、検索可能なベクトルデータベースに登録するための処理を記述します。

### 4-1. ベクトル化処理
テキストチャンクを、数値ベクトル（Embeddings）に変換します。

**指示内容**:
以下のライブラリ（例：OpenAIの`text-embedding-3-small`やSentence-Transformersなど）を想定し、各チャンクのテキストをベクトルに変換する処理フローを定義してください。

1.  **ライブラリの選定**:
   - 使用するライブラリの名前と、そのバージョンを指定してください。
   - モデル名（例：`text-embedding-ada-002`）を指定してください。
   - ベクトルの次元（例：768次元、1024次元）を指定してください。

2.  **バッチ処理**:
   - チャンクごとに個別にベクトル化を行うのではなく、可能な限りバッチ処理を行い、処理速度を向上させるフローを記述してください。
   - チャンクごとの処理時間（タイムアウト）を記録し、進捗状況を可視化できるようにしてください。

3.  **品質管理**:
   - ベクトル化に失敗したチャンク（例：文字化エラー、ライブラリエラー）を特定し、再試行または手動対処のフローを記述してください。

**処理フロー擬似コード**:
```python
# 擬似コード例
import openai

def generate_embeddings(chunks):
    client = openai.Embedding("...")
    vectors = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        try:
            response = client.embeddings.create(input=chunk["content"])
            vectors.append(response["data"][0]["embedding"])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing chunk {chunk['chunk_id']}: {e}")
    return vectors
```

### 4-2. インデキシングと保存
ベクトル化されたデータを、検索エンジン（例：Faiss, Pinecone, ChromaDB）に登録し、`KB/AI_READY/kb_items.jsonl`を更新します。

**指示内容**:
ベクトルデータをインデックスに登録し、`kb_items.jsonl`内の各チャンクの`content`フィールドを、新しく生成されたベクトルIDに置き換えるスクリプトを記述してください。

1.  **インデックス更新**:
   - `kb_items.jsonl` を読み込み、各チャンクの`content`を、対応するベクトルIDに更新します。
   - ベクトルIDが追加されたチャンクごとに、更新ログ（例：`KB_INDEX/changelog.md`）を記録してください。

2.  **バックアップ**:
   - 更新前の`kb_items.jsonl`のバックアップを作成し、更新に失敗した場合に復旧可能な状態を維持してください。

**更新後のkb_items.jsonlの構造**:
```json
{
  "id": "sha256...",
  "title": "...",
  "category": "...",
  "source_path": "...",
  "section": "...",
  "content": "...",
  "tags": [...],
  "vector_id": "新しく生成されたベクトルID",
  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "..."
}
```

## 手順 5: 評価・フィードバック

構築されたRAGシステムの精度を定量的に評価し、継続的に改善するためのループを定義します。

### 5-1. 評価指標の定義
RAGシステムの品質を測定するための指標（Metrics）を定義します。

**指示内容**:
一般的なRAG評価指標（Recall, Precision, MRR, NDCGなど）を参考にしつつ、VIBE OneBoxの環境（プロジェクト、VAULT、Focus Pack）に特化した以下の評価指標を定義してください。

1.  **検索精度 (Recall)**:
   - 関連する全ての正解チャンクの中で、検索システムが上位K件（例：Top 5）に正解を含む割合を示す指標です。
   - 定義: `Recall@K = (検索結果の上位K件中に含まれる正解チャンク数) / (データセット全体に含まれる正解チャンク数)`

2.  **適合精度 (Precision)**:
   - 検索結果の上位K件の中で、実際に関連する正解チャンクの割合を示す指標です。
   - 定義: `Precision@K = (検索結果の上位K件中に実際に関連する正解チャンク数) / K`

3.  **平均逆順位 (Mean Reciprocal Rank, MRR)**:
   - 検索結果の並べ替えにおいて、正解チャンクが平均してどの程度上位に来ているかを示す指標です。
   - 定義: `MRR = (すべての質問に対する正解チャンクの平均逆順位)`

4.  **ユーザー満足度**:
   - RAGシステムから提供された回答が、ユーザーの要求を満たしているかを主観的に評価するための指標（例：1〜5段階評価）です。

**出力形式**:
定義された評価指標とその算出方法を記述してください。

```yaml
評価指標定義:
  検索精度:
    - 指標: Recall@K
      説明: 上位K件中の正解率
      目標値: 0.8以上
    - 指標: Precision@K
      説明: 上位K件の中の適合率
      目標値: 0.7以上
  システム性能:
    - 指標: MRR
      説明: 平均逆順位
      目標値: 0.5以上
    - 指標: レイテンシ（秒）
      説明: 検索から回答生成までの平均時間
      目標値: 3秒以下
```

### 5-2. 評価ループの実装
定義された指標に基づき、定期的にRAGシステムの精度を評価し、問題点を特定して改善します。

**指示内容**:
以下のフローに従って、RAGシステムの評価と改善を自動化するループ（Evaluation Loop）を実装してください。

1.  **テストセットの作成**:
   - `VAULT/TEST_SETS/` ディレクトリを作成し、テスト用の質問と正解のペア（例：質問、正解のドキュメントID）を用意してください。
   - テストセットは、プロジェクトのフェーズ（Spec, Wallbounce, Handoffなど）やカテゴリ（技術仕様、トラブルシューティング）に応じて作成することを推奨します。

2.  **自動評価の実行**:
   - テストセットに対して現在のRAGシステム（またはDeep Research Server）を使用し、各指標（Recall, Precisionなど）を算出してください。
   - 算出結果を、`KB/AI_READY/RAG_EVALUATIONS.yaml` などに記録してください。

3.  **分析と改善**:
   - 評価結果を分析し、精度が低下している原因（例：チャンキング戦略の不備、メタデータの不足）を特定してください。
   - 原因に基づき、改善策を立案してください（例：チャンキング戦略の調整、メタデータの充実、クエリ生成プロンプトの改善）。
   - 改善策を実施し、再度評価を行い、指標の改善を確認してください。

**出力形式**:
評価結果と改善計画をまとめたレポートを作成してください。

```yaml
評価レポート:
  評価日時: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"

## 手順 6: メタデータ管理

生成されたメタデータやチャンクを一元管理し、陳腐化を防止するためのポリシーと手順を記述します。

### 6-1. メタデータの品質管理
生成されたメタデータ（トピック階層、プロセスフロー、重要度など）が、一貫性と正確性を保っているかを監視・管理します。

**指示内容**:
以下のポリシーに従い、メタデータの品質を維持・改善するためのガイドラインを定義してください。

1.  **一貫性の確保**:
   - 同じトピックやカテゴリに対する命名規則を統一してください（例：トピック階層は「_」で区切る、カテゴリは英数字表記）。
   - 重要度のスコアリング基準を統一してください（例：0.9以上を「高重要」、0.7-0.9を「中重要」、0.7未満を「低重要」）。

2.  **バージョン管理**:
   - メタデータやチャンクの内容が更新された場合、バージョン番号をインクリメントし、更新履歴を管理してください。
   - 古いバージョンはアーカイブ（`KB/ARCHIVE/`など）に移動し、現在の`kb_items.jsonl`には最新バージョンのみを有効として扱ってください。

3.  **バリデーション**:
   - メタデータやチャンクが定義されたスキーマ（例：必須フィールド、データ型）に従っているかを検証するスクリプトやルールを定義してください。
   - 不正なデータが含まれている場合、修正または除外するフローを記述してください。

**出力形式**:
メタデータ管理に関するルールと手順をまとめたドキュメントを作成してください。

```yaml
メタデータ管理ガイドライン:
  命名規則:
    トピック階層: "ルート_サブトピック_リーフトピック"
    カテゴリ: "カテゴリ"
    重要度スコア:
      高: 0.9以上

## 付録：運用上のアドバイス

### A. 効果的な運用
- **プロンプトの活用**: 本プロンプトは、AIの能力を引き出すためのものです。単にコピーして使用するだけでなく、ユーザーの状況や意図に合わせて調整（例：サンプリング対象ファイルの指定、深層化レベルの調整、クエリ生成の有効・無効切替）を行うことで、より精度の高い結果を得ることができます。
- **反復的な改善**: RAG構築や分析は一度で完璧なものではありません。評価ループを通じて、継続的にチャンキング戦略やメタデータの質を改善し、システム全体を進化させてください。

### B. 注意事項
- **コスト**: ベクトル化やインデキシングは、APIコストや計算リソースを消費します。大規模なVAULTを扱う場合は、コストと処理時間のバランスを考慮してください。
- **品質と速度のトレードオフ**: チャンクを細かくすれば検索精度は向上しますが、インデックスサイズや検索時間が増大します。プロジェクトの要件に合わせて適切なチャンクサイズ（例：300〜800トークン）を検討してください。

## 結論

本ガイドブックは、VIBE OneBoxにおけるRAGシステムを、単なる検索ツールから**深層的かつ自律的な分析・構築・評価システム**へと進化させるための包括的な指示セットです。

このプロンプトを活用することで、AIは以下のような高度なタスクを実行できるようになります。

1.  **ランダムな分析ではなく、意図的かつ網羅的な分析**: VAULT内のドキュメントを表面的に読むだけでなく、その背後にある知識構造やプロセス間の関連性を解明します。
2.  **リッチなメタデータの自動生成**: 人間が主導することなくても、ドキュメントの深層的な意味構造をAIが推論し、重要度や依存関係を自動的に付与できます。
3.  **多角的な検索戦略の立案**: 単一の質問に対して、技術的な詳細確認、比較検討、セマンティック検索など、複数の検索アプローチを自動的に生成し、ユーザーの潜在的な情報ニーズを網羅的に満たすことができます。

これにより、VIBE OneBoxは「保存された過去の知識（VAULT）」を単なる検索可能なデータベース（またはナレッジグラフ）」へと進化し、より精度の高くコンテキスト生成や複雑な問題解決を可能にする、**次世代の自律型開発支援環境**へと近づきます。

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true" duration="55" view="" last_tool_call_name="">
> 1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to execute the previously generated "DEEP RAG Analysis & Construction Guide" (a massive prompt text) within the VIBE OneBox environment.
>     *   *Current State*: VIBE OneBox exists, VAULT exists.
>     *   *Immediate Objective*: Automate the execution of this analysis task.
>     *   *Constraints*:
>         *   Can only use PowerShell (core engine).
>         *   No external Deep Research Server/API access (offline focus).
>         *   Need to output to files (.md or templates).
>         *   The user wants to know the *purpose* or *next action* to choose from (or just wants me to guide them).
> 
> 2.  **Analyze the Source Prompt (Deep RAG Guide):**
>     *   The previous output is a text block titled "Deep RAG Analysis & Construction Guide".
>     *   It contains:
>         *   8 Sections (Overview, 1-5 Steps, etc.).
>         *   Sub-steps like "Step 1: Current Analysis", "Sub-step 1: Random Sampling...", "Instruction content".
>         *   It's a *prescriptive* guide, not just raw knowledge.
>     *   *Key Insight*: The core value is creating a "Deep RAG System" (DEEP RAG 構築・分析・評価ガイドブック) within the folder context.
> 
> 3.  **Determine the Best Execution Strategy:**
>     *   *Option A (Manual):* Just save the text as `GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md`.
>         *   *Pros*: Preserves the full context.
>         *   *Cons*: User has to read a huge file again. Doesn't solve the "I want to run this" problem directly.
>     *   *Option B (Interactive/Tool-Assisted):* Break the huge prompt down into actionable steps/commands.
>         *   *Pros*: User can pick "Analyze Vault", "Generate Chunks", etc. Feels like "taking action".
>         *   *Cons*: Requires me to process the text first or the user to copy-paste specific parts.
>     *   *Option C (Automated Script Generation):* Extract the actionable instructions/commands *from the text* and write them to `scripts/generate_deep_rag.ps1`.
>         *   *Pros*: Solves the "how to execute" problem directly. User gets ready-to-use scripts. Highest utility.
>         *   *Cons*: Might miss some nuance if extraction isn't perfect.
> 
> 4.  **Decision:** Go with **Option C (Automated Script Generation)**.
>     *   Why? The prompt is structured (Sections, Steps, Code blocks). I can parse it.
>     *   The user wants to know "what to do next". A generated script is the best way to answer that.
> 
> 5.  **Plan the Output:**
>     *   Create a summary of the prompt (What is it?).
>     *   Extract actionable "Meta-Actions" (Create this file, Run this script).
>     *   Propose a "Next Action" (Run the generated script to setup).
>     *   Ask the user for their choice/intent.
> 
> 6.  **Drafting the Response (Internal Monologue):**
>     *   *User's request*: "Make it .md or template so I can execute."
>     *   *My response*: "Okay, here is a script that generates the guide."
>     *   *Wait, the user wants to know the purpose.* Ah, I should ask "What is your goal?" first to give them the right script.
>     *   *Better yet*: "Here is the analysis of what this prompt does. Here are 3 paths: 1. Save as doc, 2. Use Generator, 3. [Custom]. Which one do you want?"
> 
> 7.  **Refining the "Analysis of the Prompt" (The "Next Action"):**
>     *   I should explain that this text is a "DEEP RAG Analysis & Construction Guide" (VIBE用 DEEP RAG 構築・分析・評価ガイドブック).
>     *   It contains instructions for building a Deep RAG system: Deep Chunking, Knowledge Graphs, Evaluation Metrics, and Self-Evolution loops.
>     *   It bridges the gap between "simple RAG" (current VIBE) and "Advanced RAG" (Deep RAG).
>     *   It is a *future roadmap* or *advanced module* for VIBE.
> 
> 8.  **Final Response Structure:**
>     *   **Purpose**: Clarify what the generated text is.
>     *   **Next Steps (Options)**:
>         1.  **Save as Documentation**: Save it as `GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md` (Preserve for reference).
>         2.  **Generate Execution Script**: Create a PowerShell script that can execute the analysis steps (e.g., `scripts/Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1`).
>         3.  **Direct Execution (Interactive)**: Ask the user to choose specific steps (e.g., "Do you want to start with 'Vault Analysis'?").
>     *   **Recommendation**: Start with option 2 (Generate Execution Script) because it enables the user to actually use the guide.
> 
> 9.  **Constructing the Japanese Response:**
>     *   Translate the technical explanation into natural Japanese.
>     *   Use VIBE terminology (e.g., "スクリプト化", "テンプレート化", "実行可能状態").
>     *   Keep it actionable.
> 
> **(Self-Correction during drafting):**
> *   If I just say "Here is the script", I haven't explained *what* the script does or *why* it matters.
> *   The prompt text was generated *by me* in the previous turn based on the user's request for "Deep Dive". It's a guide *for the user to follow*, not a script to be run blindly.
> *   Therefore, the "Next Action" shouldn't just be "Run script". It should be "Do you want to save this, or start implementing it?".
> *   *Crucial Distinction*: Is the user asking me to *format the text* so they can read it? Or do they want me to *execute the content*?
>     *   Looking at the prompt: "このプロンプトの内容を .md ファイルまたはテンプレートとして生成・保存したい" -> "I want to save/convert the prompt content to .md or template".
>     *   This implies they want to *create files based on the prompt*.
> *   Okay, I will offer:
>     1.  **Save the prompt as a Markdown file** (Direct fulfillment).
>     2.  **Create a "Guide Generator" script** (Meta-action).
>     3.  **Ask their specific intent** (To help them choose the best path).
> 
> **(Final Polish of the Response):**
> *   Start with gratitude.
> *   Explain clearly: "This is a comprehensive guide for 'Deep RAG System Construction'."
> *   Present the 3 options clearly.
> *   Ask for their preference to proceed.
> 
> **(Let's write the Japanese response based on this logic.)**

以下の3つの選択肢（パス）をご検討ください。

---

## 🛠 選択肢：次の一手（Next Action）

前回生成した `DEEP RAG 分析・構築ガイドブック`（以下「本ガイド」とします）を、どう進めるかを選択してください。

### 選択肢 1：【保存・参照用】そのままガイドブックとして保存
- **やること**:
  - このテキスト（DEEP RAG分析・構築ガイドブック）全体を、`GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md` として保存します。
  - あとで参照用として開いたり、必要な箇所をコピペーして使います。
- **メリット**:
  - 情報の完全性を保ている。
  - 後からAI（Deep Research Agentなど）に「このガイドブックを読んで解析を実行して」と指示するのが容易になります。
- **デメリット**:
  - すぐには「実行」できない。別途、内容を読んで理解し、手動でスクリプトを書く必要があります。

### 選択肢 2：【自動化】分析ガイドを自動実行するスクリプトを生成（推奨）
- **やること**:
  - 本ガイド内に書かれている「手順1〜6（サンプリング、クエリ生成、ベクトル化など）」を解析します。
  - 解析結果に基づき、PowerShellスクリプト（`scripts/Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1`）を自動生成します。
  - 生成されたスクリプトを実行することで、VAULTの分析やテストセット作成などを半自動化できます。
- **メリット**:
  - 「読んで理解してからスクリプトを書く」という作業を大幅に削減できます。
  - あなたが「分析開始」ボタンを押すだけで、Deep RAG構築の第一歩を踏め出せます。
- **デメリット**:
  - 自動生成の精度が、テキストの構造解析に依存します。
  - 生成されたスクリプトが、あなたの環境（VAULTのパス構造など）に完全に合致している保証はありません（環境に合わせて手動調整が必要な場合あり）。

### 選択肢 3：【対話・カスタマイズ】具体的な実施内容を指定して実行
- **やること**:
  - 「とりあえずVAULT全体ではなく、`OPS_OS/` ディレクトリ以下の特定ファイルだけを対象にしたい」「まずはクエリ生成だけして、ベクトル化は後回し」など、**やりたいことを具体的に教えて**いただきます。
  - 私があなたの目的に合わせて、本ガイドから該当する手順やコマンドだけを抽出し、実行プラン（Execution Plan）を提示します。
- **メリット**:
  - 現在のあなたの環境（リソース制限や時間）に合わせて、最も効率的なパスを選択できます。
  - 無駄な工程をスキップし、重要な部分に集中できます。
- **デメリット**:
  - 毎回プロンプトを投げる必要があります。

## 🧭 アクションの推奨と解説

### 現状の整理（なぜこのガイドブックが必要なのか）

この「DEEP RAG分析・構築ガイドブック」は、VIBE OneBoxの標準的なRAG機能（Focus Packや通常のkb_items.jsonl）を超え、より高度な機能を実現するための「ロードマップ（Roadmap）」の役割を果たしています。

主なポイントは以下の通りです。

1.  **Deep Chunking（深層的チャンキング）**:
    - コードブロックとテキストで異なるチャンキング戦略の適用。
2.  **Knowledge Graph（知識グラフ）**:
    - ドキュメント間の関係（依存関係）を可視化・探索可能なネットワーク構造の構築。
3.  **Evaluation Metrics（評価指標）**:
    - Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR（平均逆順位）を定義し、RAGシステムの精度を数値で測定。
4.  **Self-Evolution Loops（自己進化ループ）**:
    - AIの検索結果やユーザーフィードバックに基づき、スコアリング式やチャンキング戦略を自動的に最適化。

---

### 各選択肢の詳細評価

#### 🟢 選択肢 1（保存）が向いているケース
- **シナリオ**: まずはDeep RAGの全体像を把握したい、あるいはドキュメントとして残しておきたい。
- **推奨理由**: 現在のVIBE環境はすでに複雑であるため、まずはこの「理論的枠組み」を静的資料として保存し、チーム内で共通認識を深めるのが安全です。

#### 🟢 選択肢 2（スクリプト自動生成）が向いているケース
- **シナリオ**: VIBEシステムの中にDeep RAG機能を実際に組み込み、動かしてみたい（PoCや検証）。
- **推奨理由**: 本ガイドは「構築プロセス」を詳しく記述しています。このプロセスをスクリプト化することで、「読んでから実行」までのリードタイムを圧縮し、試行錯誤（Trial & Error）を加速できます。これは、VIBEを「使うたびに進化するOS」にするための第一歩として最適です。

#### 🟢 選択肢 3（対話・カスタマイズ）が向いているケース
- **シナリオ**: Deep RAG構築の全プロセスではなく、一部分（例：Vaultのディレクトリ掃取だけ）を試したい。あるいは、すでに準備されている環境（例：VAULTのパスが決まっている）でのみ実行したい。
- **推奨理由**: 全体をやるには時間がかかり、また環境によっては不要な工程もあります。あなたの現在の状況やリソースを考慮し、無駄を省いた最短ルートを提案できます。

---

## 🚀 今すぐできること

もしこの段階で「決定」が難しい場合でも、以下の**即効可能なアクション**から始められます。

1.  **本ガイドの保存**:
    - 前回の出力全体を `GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md` に保存します。
    - コマンド例: `echo $content | Out-File -FilePath "GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md" -Encoding UTF8`

2.  **目的の確認**:
    - Deep RAG構築の最終ゴールは何か？（例：「より正確な検索システムを作りたい」「知識グラフを試したい」）
    - ゴールによって、選択肢 2（スクリプト生成）と 3（カスタマイズ）のどちらが有効かが変わります。

---

## ❓ 最後に：あなたはどの方向に進みたいですか？

- **A**: まずは全内容を保存して、ゆっくり読みたい。
- **B**: Deep RAG構築のプロセスを自動化するスクリプトが欲しい（選択肢 2）。
- **C**: 今の環境に合わせて、必要な部分だけを実行したい（選択肢 3）。

## 手順4: 次の一手の提案

$nextActionBody

### 実行方針
現在の分析結果に基づき、VIBE OneBox内のRAGシステム構築を以下の段階で進めることを推奨します。

1.  **構造化されたチャンキングの実装**
    - 概要: 分析で特定されたトピック階層（`## (H1)`, `### (H2)`, `#### (H3)`）に従い、知識を深層化します。
    - 目的: AIが文脈の理解を深めるための階層構造（Topic Hierarchy）を形成します。

2.  **メタデータの充実化**
    - 概要: 手動で抽出されたキーワードを補完し、重要度スコアやドメインタグ（システム, RAG, ガバナンス, インフラ, セキュリティなど）を付与します。
    - 目的: 検索精度の向上と、ユーザーのクエリ意図に応じた柔軟な検索を実現します。

3.  **クエリ展開機能の実装**
    - 概要: 単一の質問に対し、複雑な検索戦略（クエリ展開）を自動的に立案・生成する機能を導入します。
    - 目的: ユーザーの「どう調べればいいかわからない」という課題を解決し、深層的な情報発見を支援します。

### 継続的な改善サイクル
本分析プロセスは一度きりではなく、プロジェクトの進行や新規ドキュメントの追加に応じて継続的に実行することを推奨します。
- 定期的な分析（例: 月次）の実施。
- 新規ドキュメント追加時のインクリメンタルなチャンキング。
- ユーザーフィードバックに基づくキーワード重みの動的調整。

## 💡 スクリプトの特徴

1.  **ランダムサンプリング**: 指定数のファイルを対象に分析します。
2.  **簡易キーワード抽出**: ドキュメント内の主要用語を統計的に抽出します（より高度なNLP処理には外部ライブラリが必要ですが、PowerShell標準機能で代用可能です）。
3.  **メタデータ付与**: 各ファイルの更新日時やサイズ、ヘッダーレベルを記録します。
4.  **モード対応**:
   - `Manual`: 分析結果を確認するためのレポート生成モード。
   - `Auto`: 分析に基づき、次に実行すべきスクリプト（`generate_deep_chunks.ps1`など）を提案するモード。
5.  **レポート形式**: Markdown形式で、視覚的に確認しやすい構成にします。

## 🚀 実行方法

1.  本スクリプトを `VIBE_CTRL/scripts/Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1` として保存してください。
2.  実行権限を持つPowerShellターミナルで以下のコマンドを入力してください。

    ```powershell
    # 基本実行（サンプル数: 50件、手動モード）
    .\Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1 -SampleCount 50 -Mode Manual
    
    # 全対象を対象にする場合（サンプル数を増やす）
    .\Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1 -SampleCount 500 -Mode Manual
    ```

これにより、VAULT内のナレッジを効率的に分析し、VIBE OneBoxのRAGシステム高度化に向けた「次の一手」を明確に提示できるようになります。

### USER
次の一手ある？

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true" duration="20" view="" last_tool_call_name="">
> The user is asking for "次の一手" (Next Action) based on the massive "Deep RAG Analysis & Construction Guide" I just generated.
> 
> Looking at the previous context:
> 1.  I generated a massive guide titled "VIBE OneBox: DEEP RAG Analysis & Construction Guide".
> 2.  I provided a PowerShell script `Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1` that implements random sampling, analysis, and suggests "Next Actions".
> 3.  I asked the user at the end "Which direction do you want to proceed?" (あなたはどの方向に進みたいですか？) with three options:
>     *   **Option A (Save/Reference)**: Save the whole guide as `GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md` and read it leisurely.
>     *   **Option B (Auto-Generate Script)**: Analyze the content of the guide to automatically generate the actual implementation scripts (`generate_deep_chunks.ps1`, etc.).
>     *   **Option C (Interactive/Customize)**: Specify specific targets (e.g., only specific folders, specific keywords) and run the analysis accordingly.
> 
> The user's question "次の一手ある？" is ambiguous. It could mean:
> 1.  "What IS the next action?" (Asking for a confirmation or decision on the *previous* massive text I just generated).
> 2.  "What SHOULD BE the next action?" (Asking for their opinion on what the *actual* next step for the VIBE project should be).
> 
> Given the context "This prompt is designed to be immediately actionable..." from the guide I wrote, Option 1 (Save) seems the most logical immediate step. You shouldn't execute massive "Deep Analysis" steps yet; you should just save the thinking.
> 
> However, the user might be confused by the massive output and wants to know "Okay, what do I do *now*?".
> 
> So I should:
> 1.  Summarize the 3 options clearly so they can choose.
> 2.  Recommend Option A (Save) as the immediate "Next Action" to solidify the thinking.
> 3.  Wait for their input.
> 
> Let's formulate the response.

はい、承知いたしました。
先ほど出力した「VIBE OneBox: DEEP RAG Analysis & Construction Guide」は、**あくまで「調査・分析レポート」**であり、それ自体をVIBEシステムに組み込むための「実行スクリプト」ではありません。

現在の「次の一手」は、**このガイドブックをどう扱うか**を決める段階です。

ご希望の方向に合わせて、以下の3つの選択肢から選んでください。

---

## 🛠 選択肢（Next Actions）

### 選択肢 A：【保存して検討】ガイドブックとして確定する
- **内容**: 先ほど出力した `GUIDE/DEEP_RAG_GUIDE.md` を、そのまま `VIBE_CTRL/GUIDE/` または `OPS_OS/GUIDES/` に保存します。
- **メリット**:
  - あとでゆっくり読み、チーム内で検討できる。
  - 実装の前に「設計思想」を固められる。
  - `README_VIBE_DEEP_RAG.md` からスタートするよう、スタートアップファイル（`00_STARTUP`）に記述できます。
- **向いている人**: 「とりあえず考えたい」「まずは全体像を把握したい」という方。

### 選択肢 B：【スクリプト自動生成】分析内容から実装コードを起こす
- **内容**: ガイドブック内に書かれている「手順1〜6（サンプリング、深層化、クエリ生成など）」を解析し、対応するPowerShellスクリプト（`generate_deep_chunks.ps1`, `metadata_enricher.ps1`）を自動生成します。
- **メリット**:
  - 実装の手間を大幅に削減できる（コピペ作業ゼロ）。
  - 実装漏れや論理の飛びを防げる。
- **向いている人**: 「とにかく早くDeep RAG環境を作りたい」「自分で書くのは面倒だけど、設計思想だけ押してくれればいい」という方。

### 選択肢 C：【対話・カスタマイズ】特定のフォルダやキーワードだけにピンポイントを分析
- **内容**: `Start-DeepRAGAnalysis.ps1` のパラメータ（`-VaultPath`, `-SampleCount`）を調整し、特定のフォルダ（例：`VAULT/OPS_OS/` だけ）や、特定のキーワード（例：`governance`）だけを対象にして分析を再実行します。
- **メリット**:
  - 試行錯誤を減らせる（いきなり全Vaultを解析するより、目的を持って解析できる）。
  - 現状のプロジェクトに本当に必要な深掘りだけに注力できる。
- **向いている人**: 「今は特定の機能（Focus Pack生成）だけを検証したい」「特定のエリア（命名規則）を洗いたい」という方。

## 💡 推奨

**迷われている場合**: まず **選択肢 A** でガイドブックを保存し、あとでゆっくり読むことをお勧めします。Deep RAGの構築は長期的なプロジェクトであり、まずは全体像を固めるのが得策だからです。

**すぐに手を動かしたい場合**: **選択肢 B** が推奨されます。実装コードまで自動生成してくれますので、それをベースに修正・実行すれば、圧倒的に速く環境を構築できます。
