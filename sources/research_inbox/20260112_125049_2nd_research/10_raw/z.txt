 in a regulated healthcare documentation task, but the patterns generalize
to any domain that demands accuracy, auditability, and rapid iteration. ###
 What You Will Learn * Diagnose why an autonomous agent falls short of prod
uction readiness and instrument it with measurable feedback signals. * Comp
are three prompt-optimization strategies—from quick manual iteration to ful
ly automated loops—and understand when to reach for each. * Assemble a self

Matters ---------------- **Evolver is the first meta AI agent that makes AI
 agents truly autonomous**—not just in execution, but in self-improvement.
We’re not replacing prompt engineers. We’re giving them **superpowers**. In
stead of manually testing hundreds of variations, you define what “good” lo

AI Agents only a few years ago…prompt engineering, templates, prompt chaini

 on these topics, and one can see based on the content how the Language Mod

egrate planning, tool use, and autonomous workflows around large language m

ク定義 ### タスク1: Vault全体スキャン - **目的**: Vault内の全ファイルを走査
し、プロジェクト関連ファイルを特定 - **入力**: $vaultDir - **出力**: ファイ
ルリスト（ファイル名/サイズ/更新日時） - **フィルタ条件**: - 拡張子: .md, .
txt, .ps1, .cmd, .yaml, .json - 除外: .git, node_modules, temp ### タスク2:
 関連度スコアリング - **目的**: 各ファイルのプロジェクト関連度をスコアリン
グ - **スコアリング基準**: - キーワード一致（"VIBE", "CTRL", "STATUS", "OPS
"など）: +10点 - 最近更新（7日以内）: +5点 - ファイルサイズ（1KB以上100KB未
満）: +3点 - **出力**: スコア付きファイルリスト ### タスク3: KB_SELECTED生

上位20ファイルを選択 - 合計サイズ500KB以下に調整 - セクション別に整理（Scri
pts/Prompts/Docs） - **出力先**: Vault/KB_SELECTED/PROJECT_KB.md --- ## 📝

’ve been fascinated by how quickly Generative AI is changing the way we bui

reading documentation and watching demos — I wanted to **build something re

r questions using _your own documents_ — accurately, reliably, and with cit
ations — felt incredibly powerful. So, I decided to finally dive in and bui

lications†https://www.astera.com/type/blog/building-a-knowledge-base-rag]\n
When you build a RAG application you face a fundamental choice about where
to store and retrieve information. You can invest in a full knowledge graph
 that captures entities and relationships with precise structure, or you ca
n take a more traditional approach by building a knowledge base built on do
cument collections and vector search. Knowledge graphs excel at modeling re
lationships and supporting multi-hop reasoning. However, there are strong a
rguments for beginning with a knowledge base for RAG applications. In this
article we’ll guide you through the purpose of a knowledge base in terms of
 RAG, how to design and implement one, and what best practices you can foll
ow to ensure performance and accuracy as your content grows. An Overview of

and install its dependencies to ensure all required libraries are properly
configured. Create a dedicated directory for model files to keep things org

feels familiar: autocomplete/tab flows, sidebars, and the ability to jump i
n and finish the last 10% yourself. The core idea is not to replace the edi
tor, but to pair it with agent workflows, so you can switch from orchestrat
ion to direct control whenever needed. That pairing matters in real-world t
eams, because autonomy is rarely “all or nothing.” Many tasks are safe to d

AG is the **chunking process**, where large documents are divided into smal
ler, more manageable pieces called “**chunks**.” These chunks are then inde
xed and used during the retrieval phase to provide contextually relevant in
formation to the language model. Why Chunking Matters --------------------
Chunking serves multiple purposes in RAG: * **Efficiency**: Smaller chunks
reduce computational overhead during retrieval. * **Relevance**: Precise ch
unks increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant information. * **Contex
t Preservation**: Proper chunking maintains the integrity of the informatio
n, ensuring coherent responses. However, inappropriate chunking can lead to
: * **Loss of Context**: Breaking information at arbitrary points can disru
pt meaning. * **Redundancy**:\n\n[ref_id=turn0search6†Mastering Chunking St

snt-one-size-fits-all]\nChunking defines the boundaries of the data that wi
ll be embedded. Each chunk should encapsulate a coherent idea so it can be
retrieved independently. During retrieval, these chunks are surfaced and fe
d into the model’s prompt for answer synthesis. Longer chunks preserve more
 context but risk **embedding dilution**. The vector must represent too man
y distinct concepts, making it less focused and harder to retrieve for spec
ific queries. For example, imagine a chunk spanning 15 articles of law, one
 of which covers civil responsibility in boat accidents. Although the LLM w
ould gain rich context if that chunk were retrieved, the embedding itself m
ay struggle to surface for a query about _boats_, since that topic represen
