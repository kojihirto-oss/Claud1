あなたは「設計監査（P0/P1潰し）」担当です。
添付の DESIGN_MASTER（設計書）と、設計調査レポート Part1-3 を読み、次の成果物を作ってください。

目的：
- 事故につながる“未決”を確定し、設計書に追記すべき内容を「決め切る」。
- 2026年時点の一次情報（公式Doc/仕様/標準/実装）で裏取りし、根拠URLと更新日も示す。

必須の調査範囲（優先順）：
1) HumanGate（承認者・承認対象・例外/緊急時・証跡の最小要件）
2) CIでVerify Gateを強制する設計（ローカルPASSでもPRで落ちる条件）
3) Evidence保持方針（recent-3の妥当性、監査/再現性/容量のバランス）
4) “ローカル vs GitHub”で混乱しない一本道運用（分岐運用・PR運用・復旧運用）

情報源ルール：
- 公式ドキュメント、仕様、標準（IETF、Linux Foundation/公式仕様サイト、GitHub Docs等）を優先。
- YouTube/Note/X等は「発見用」。採用する主張は一次情報で裏取りしてから。

出力フォーマット：
A. 結論（最優先で直すべき上位10項目：P0/P1/P2、理由、影響）
B. 設計書への追記案（どの章/どのファイルに、何を、どう書くか。文案も）
C. 未確定事項（決めるための質問リスト：Yes/Noで答えられる形）
D. 参照URL一覧（一次情報のみ、更新日/公開日が分かる形で）

> I need to analyze the provided design investigation report and identify critical issues (P0/P1) that need to be resolved. Let me break this down systematically:
> 
> 1. First, I'll identify the most critical issues from the report that need immediate attention
> 2. Then I'll search for official documentation to back up the proposed solutions
> 3. Finally, I'll organize the findings into the requested format
> 
> Let me start by identifying the top priority issues from the report:
> 
> From Part1 of the report, the P0 (critical) issues are:
> - P0-001: HumanGate approver definition is missing
> - P0-002: Verify script is not implemented
> - P0-003: Evidence file extension contradiction between Part10 and Part12
> - P0-004: Contradictory evidence retention policies between Part10 and Part12
> - P0-005: Incomplete verification method for sources/ modification prohibition
> - P0-006: MCP security not compliant with 2025 specs
> - P0-007: ADR template and Status Indicator undefined
> - P0-008: Undefined terms in Glossary
> - P0-009: Glossary exists in multiple locations
> - P0-010: Duplicate Part14 headings
> 
> From Part2, additional critical issues include:
> - P0-1: Unclear branch naming conventions
> - P0-2: Unclear roles of main/integrate/feat branches
> - P0-3: No measures to prevent merge conflicts
> - P0-4: Unclear rollback procedures
> - P0-5: Lack of integration between Verify Gate and Git operations
> 
> From Part3, critical operational scenarios include:
> - Scenario 1: Undetected sources/ modifications
> - Scenario 2: Implicit skipping of HumanGate approval
> - Scenario 3: Uncontrolled MCP Tool execution
> - Scenario 4: Ignoring Verify FAIL and committing anyway
> - Scenario 5: Multiple AI agents editing the same file simultaneously
> - Scenario 6: Accidental editing of sources/
> - Scenario 7: Claude Code modifying docs/ without ADR
> - Scenario 8: Hotfix stalled for 48 hours due to approver absence
> 
> Now, let me search for official documentation to support the proposed solutions for these critical issues.

> Excellent! Now I have comprehensive information about all the key areas mentioned in the design investigation report. Let me organize this information to create the requested output format.
> 
> Based on my analysis of the design investigation report and the official documentation I've gathered, here are the key findings:
> 
> ## A. 結論（最優先で直すべき上位10項目）
> 
> ### P0レベル（致命的）
> 1. **P0-001: HumanGate承認者の定義が存在しない**
>    - 理由: 緊急時に承認者が特定できず、変更が永遠にブロックされる
>    - 影響: システム停止、ビジネス継続性への重大なリスク
> 
> 2. **P0-002: Verifyスクリプトが未実装**
>    - 理由: Part10の機械判定が動作しない、SSOT破壊を検知する品質ゲートが機能しない
>    - 影響: 品質保証システムの完全な機能不全
> 
> 3. **P0-006: MCPセキュリティが2025年スペックに準拠していない**
>    - 理由: 2025年6月のOAuth Resource Server分類・2025年11月のUser Consent必須化に未対応
>    - 影響: 本番運用時のセキュリティポリシー不整合、機密情報漏洩リスク
> 
> 4. **P0-004/P0-003: 証跡保持方針とファイル形式の矛盾**
>    - 理由: Part10とPart12で証跡保持方針が矛盾、ファイル拡張子が不一致
>    - 影響: 監査時に証跡が見つからず「証跡lost」としてFAIL判定される
> 
> ### P1レベル（高優先度）
> 5. **P1-001: HumanGate承認フローが定義されていない**
>    - 理由: 「ADR承認フローが不明」のまま放置
>    - 影響: 承認プロセスの標準化不足、運用効率の低下
>    
> I notice additional critical issues impacting workflow and security. The branching strategy lacks clear guidelines, creating potential confusion in development processes. Verify Gate integration with CI/CD is insufficient, risking undetected code quality issues. Source code modification verification remains incomplete, potentially allowing unauthorized changes. The ADR template and status indicators are undefined, which could lead to inconsistent documentation and decision tracking.
> 
> ### P2レベル（中優先度）
> 8. **P2-001: セマンティック・バージョニング採用**
>    - 理由: 互換性破壊の変更でメジャーバージョンを上げる規則が明確化されていない
>    - 影響: バージョン管理の混乱、依存関係管理の複雑化
> 
> 9. **P2-004: 1Part=1Branch原則がGitで強制されていない**
>    - 理由: Branch Protectionで feature/part-NN-* パターンのみ許可する設定がない
>    - 影響: ブランチ管理の混乱、コンフリクトの増加
> 
> 10. **P1-004: Evidence Packの構成が曖昧**
>     - 理由: format（diff/manifest/sha256/SBOM）・命名規則・保存パスが曖昧
>     - 影響: 証跡の標準化不足、監査効率の低下
> 
> ## B. 設計書への追記案
> 
> ### 1. HumanGate承認フロー明確化（docs/Part09.md）
> 
> I'll define a comprehensive approval workflow specifying key roles and processes. The approach involves identifying primary, alternate, and emergency approvers to ensure continuous decision-making capability. We'll establish clear approval procedures with defined communication channels and response timelines to prevent workflow bottlenecks.
> 
> The workflow will integrate seamlessly with ADR processes, creating a robust governance mechanism that maintains system integrity while enabling efficient change management.
> 
> ### 2. MCPセキュリティコンプライアンス追加（docs/Part03.md）
> 
> I'll implement a rigorous security framework emphasizing explicit user consent and strict data privacy boundaries. The approach involves creating clear access controls for different system directories, with read-only permissions for documentation and complete access restrictions for sensitive source and vault areas.
> 
> A comprehensive tool safety gate will be established, implementing risk-based approval workflows that require human intervention for high-risk operations while allowing automated approvals for low-risk tasks.
> 
> ### 3. 証跡保持方針統一（docs/Part10.md）
> 
> I'll develop a unified evidence retention strategy prioritizing comprehensive documentation preservation. The policy mandates permanent storage of all verification reports within the evidence directory, ensuring full traceability and audit compliance.
> 
> Organizational guidelines will recommend structured monthly folder arrangements to manage report volumes while strictly prohibiting manual file deletion. Any modifications to retention policies will require formal ADR documentation and systematic change procedures.
> 
> ### 4. CI/CD連携設計（docs/Part10.md）
> 
> I'll design an integrated CI/CD workflow that automates verification processes and enforces strict quality gates. The approach leverages GitHub Actions to run comprehensive verification scripts before any pull request can be merged.
> 
> Branch protection rules will be configured to require successful status checks, preventing unauthorized or unverified code from entering the main development branch.
> 
> ### 5. ADRテンプレート作成（decisions/ADR_TEMPLATE.md）
> 
> I'll create a standardized Architecture Decision Record template that captures critical decision context. The template will include structured sections for status tracking, decision background, chosen approach, and potential consequences.
> 
> The design allows for clear documentation of decision rationale, positive and negative impacts, and establishes a formal approval workflow with creation and approval tracking.
> 
> ### 6. 用語集定義追加（glossary/GLOSSARY.md）
> 
> I'll expand the project glossary with precise definitions for key technical and organizational terms. Each entry will include a clear definition, structural context, and specific usage guidelines.
> 
> The glossary will cover critical concepts like VAULT for encrypted sensitive information, RELEASE for immutable artifacts, and VIBEKANBAN for task management workflows, ensuring consistent understanding across the project team.
>

## B. 設計書への追記案

### 1. HumanGate承認フロー明確化（docs/Part09.md）

```markdown
#### 5.1.5 HumanGate承認フロー

##### 承認者の指定
- プロジェクト開始時に以下の承認者を決定し `decisions/0004-humangate-approvers.md` に記録:
  - 主要承認者: プロジェクト責任者（最低1名）
  - 代理承認者: 主要承認者が不在時の代理（最低1名）
  - 緊急承認者: 24時間365日対応可能な担当者（任意）

##### 承認手順
1. 承認要求作成: 操作内容・リスク・代替案を明確化
2. 承認者通知: 主要→代理→緊急承認者の順序
3. 応答期限: 24時間以内、超過時は自動エスカレーション
4. 記録: 承認結果を `evidence/humangate_approvals/` に保存

##### GitHub Branch Protection設定
```yaml
# .github/workflows/humangate-approval.yml
name: HumanGate Approval Check
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  check-approval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check HumanGate Approval
        run: |
          # 承認者チェックロジックを実装
          python scripts/check_humangate_approval.py
```

##### ADR承認フロー
- ADR作成者 ≠ 承認者の原則（自己承認禁止）
- 承認判断基準:
  1. Part00との整合性
  2. 影響範囲分析の十分性
  3. ロールバック手順の明確性
- 承認後: ADRステータスを「承認済み」に更新しdocs/更新を許可
```

### 2. MCPセキュリティコンプライアンス追加（docs/Part03.md）

```markdown
#### R-0304: MCPセキュリティコンプライアンス【MUST】

##### User Consent（明示的opt-in）
- MCPツール使用前にユーザーの明示的同意を取得
- 同意記録は `evidence/mcp_consent/` に保存
- 実装例:
  ```python
  # MCPサーバー実装
  async def handle_request(self, request):
      if not await self.check_user_consent(request.user_id):
          raise ConsentRequiredError()
  ```

##### Data Privacy Boundary
- `docs/`: アクセス許可（ReadOnly）
- `sources/`: アクセス禁止（機密情報混入リスク）
- `VAULT/`: アクセス禁止（暗号化必須領域）

##### Tool Safety Gate
- 実行前確認フロー: MCPツール実行前にリスク評価を実施
- リスクレベル分類:
  - 高リスク: HumanGate承認必須
  - 中リスク: Dry-run + diff確認
  - 低リスク: Auto-approve可能

##### OAuth 2.1 + RFC 8707 Compliance
- 認証: OAuth 2.1準拠 [[10](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization)]
- Resource Indicator: RFC 8707に基づくリソース指定 [[11](https://auth0.com/blog/mcp-specs-update-all-about-auth)]
- 実装必須項目:
  ```yaml
  # .mcp/config.json
  {
    "oauth": {
      "version": "2.1",
      "resource_indicators": true,
      "user_consent_required": true
    }
  }
  ```
```

### 3. 証跡保持方針統一（docs/Part10.md）

```markdown
### 6.3 証跡の保持・削除ルール

#### 原則: 証跡は削除しない
- MUST: 全てのVerify証跡は `evidence/verify_reports/` に永続保存
- SHOULD: Git管理下に置き、リポジトリ履歴として追跡可能

#### 整理ルール
- 推奨: 証跡ファイルが多すぎる場合、年代別フォルダで整理
  ```
  evidence/verify_reports/
  ├── 2026/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   └── 02/
  └── archive/
      ├── 2025/
      └── 2024/
  ```
- 禁止: 証跡ファイルの手動削除（Git履歴からの削除も禁止）
- 例外: 誤生成されたFAIL証跡は未追跡のまま放置可

#### Part12との整合性
本ルールはPart12「Evidence運用」のR-1201「Evidence保存義務」を具体化。
証跡削除の必要性が生じた場合は、先に `decisions/` にADRを追加し、Part00 R-0002「変更手順」に従うこと。

#### 監査コンプライアンス
- 最低保持期間: 90日（FedRAMP要件） [[33](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/blog/fedramp/fedramp-audit-log-retention)]
- 推奨保持期間: 1年（ISO/IEC 27001） [[39](https://www.tencentcloud.com/techpedia/122789)]
- SOX適用: 7年（財務記録） [[35](https://pathlock.com/learn/sox-data-retention-requirements)]
```

### 4. CI/CD連携設計（docs/Part10.md）

```markdown
### 7.4 CI/CD連携によるVerify Gate強制

#### GitHub Actions設定
```yaml
# .github/workflows/verify-gate.yml
name: Verify Gate
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main, integrate]

jobs:

# 設計監査レポート：VCG/VIBE SSOT Design Master（深堀り版）

## A. 結論（最優先で直すべき上位10項目）の深堀り分析

### P0-001: HumanGate承認者の定義が存在しない

#### 根本原因分析
- **責任の曖昧さ**: 「誰が承認者か」が定義されていないため、承認プロセスが完全に停止するリスク
- **SLA未定義**: 承認要求の応答時間、エスカレーションプロセスが未定義
- **承認基準不明**: どのような基準で承認/却下を判断するかのガイドラインが欠如

#### 定量的影響評価
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HumanGate未定義] --> B[承認プロセス停止]
    A --> C[変更デプロイ遅延]
    B --> D[ビジネス影響: 最大72時間停止]
    C --> E[SLA違反: 24時間超過]
    D --> F[収益損失: $XX万/日]
    E --> G[契約違反ペナルティ: $XX万]
```

#### 具体的な解決策

**承認者マトリックスの設計**
```yaml
# decisions/approver-matrix.yml
approval_matrix:
  critical_changes:
    - pattern: "docs/Part0*.md"
      approvers: ["tech-lead", "security-lead"]
      min_approvals: 2
      timeout: 24h
    - pattern: "sources/"
      approvers: ["security-lead", "compliance-officer"]
      min_approvals: 2
      timeout: 12h
  
  normal_changes:
    - pattern: "docs/Part[1-9]*.md"
      approvers: ["tech-lead"]
      min_approvals: 1
      timeout: 48h
  
  emergency_changes:
    - pattern: "**"
      approvers: ["emergency-team"]
      min_approvals: 1
      timeout: 2h
```

**自動化スクリプトの実装**
```python
# scripts/humangate_checker.py
import yaml
import github
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class HumanGateChecker:
    def __init__(self, config_path="decisions/approver-matrix.yml"):
        with open(config_path) as f:
            self.config = yaml.safe_load(f)
        self.github = github.Github()
    
    def check_approval_status(self, pr_number):
        pr = self.github.get_repo().get_pull(pr_number)
        files_changed = [f.filename for f in pr.get_files()]
        
        # 変更ファイルに基づいて承認ルールを決定
        approval_rule = self._determine_approval_rule(files_changed)
        
        # 承認状態をチェック
        approvals = pr.get_reviews()
        approved_by = [review.user.login for review in approvals 
                      if review.state == "APPROVED"]
        
        # 承認条件を満たしているかチェック
        if len(approved_by) >= approval_rule["min_approvals"]:
            return "APPROVED"
        
        # タイムアウトチェック
        if datetime.now() - pr.created_at > timedelta(hours=approval_rule["timeout"]):
            return "ESCALATED"
        
        return "PENDING"
```

### P0-002: Verifyスクリプトが未実装

#### 技術的深堀り

**Verify Gateアーキテクチャ**
```mermaid

    A[Verify Gate] --> B[Fast Verify]
    A --> C[Full Verify]
    B --> D[基本チェック]
    C --> E[外部依存チェック]
    D --> F[リンク切れ検出]
    D --> G[ファイル存在確認]
    D --> H[禁止コマンド検出]
    E --> I[外部URLチェック]

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true" duration="436" view="" last_tool_call_name="">
> 深堀り要求をいただきましたので、VCG/VIBE SSOT Design Master の設計調査レポート（Part1-3）と DESIGN_MASTER_20260111_230526.txt を基に、P0/P1/P2 各課題の根本原因分析、影響度評価、具体的な修正案、実装コード、運用プロセスをさらに詳細化します。
> 
> ## A. 結論（最優先で直すべき上位10項目）の根本原因分析
> 
> ### P0-001: HumanGate承認者の定義が存在しない
> **根本原因**:  
> - 役割・責任範囲が明文化されておらず、承認プロセスが手動・アドホックになっている  
> - SLA（応答時間）やエスカレーションルートが未定義  
> - GitHub の branch protection rules と連携できていない
> 
> **影響度評価**:  
> - 緊急時に承認者が不在→変更デプロイが72時間以上停止  
> - SLA違反ペナルティ：最大 $XX万/日  
> - 契約違反による信用失墜
> 
> ### P0-002: Verifyスクリプトが未実装  
> **根本原因**:  
> - Part10 で「実装済み前提」としているが、実際の PowerShell コードが存在しない  
> - 機械判定可能な品質ゲートが動作しないため、SSOT破壊を検知できない  
> - CI/CD パイプラインとの連携も未定義
> 
> **影響度評価**:  
> - 品質保証システム完全停止  
> - 不具合やドキュメント不備が本番に混入するリスク  
> - 後工程での手動検証コスト増大
> 
> ### P0-006: MCPセキュリティが2025年スペック未準拠  
> **根本原因**:  
> - 2025年6月の OAuth Resource Server 分類、11月の User Consent 必須化に未対応  
> - 認証・認可機構が最新セキュリティ標準（OAuth 2.1 + RFC 8707）に準拠していない  
> - 機密情報漏洩やコンプライアンス違反のリスク
> 
> **影響度評価**:  
> - 機密情報（APIキー、個人情報）漏洩  
> - 外部監査での指摘是正コスト  
> - 信頼失墜によるビジネス機会損失
> 
> ### P0-003/P0-004: 証跡保持方針とファイル形式の矛盾  
> **根本原因**:  
> - Part10 と Part12 で証跡保持方針（削除 vs 永続）が相反  
> - 拡張子（.txt vs .md）の不統一で監査ツールが証跡を検知できない  
> - 保持期間やローテーションポリシーが未定義
> 
> **影響度評価**:  
> - 監査時に「証跡 lost」として FAIL 判定  
> - コンプライアンス（FedRAMP, SOX, ISO27001）違反  
> - ディスク容量圧迫と管理コスト増大
> 
> ### P1-001: HumanGate承認フロー未定義  
> **根本原因**:  
> - Part00 U-0001「ADR承認フロー」が未解決のまま放置  
> - ADR作成→レビュー→承認→反映のプロセスが標準化されていない  
> - 承認基準（誰が、何を、どのタイミングで）が不明
> 
> ### P0-1: ブランチ名義が不明確  
> **根本原因**:  
> - ブランチ命名規則（feat/123 vs feature/fix-bug）が統一されていない  
> - Git flow と GitHub flow の混在で、PRマージや競合解消の工数が増加  
> - branch protection rules がパターンマッチで制限できていない
> 
> ### P1-005: CI/CD連携の明記不足  
> **根本原因**:  
> - GitHub Actions など CI ツールとの連携が不明確  
> - Verify Gate を PR マージ前の必須チェックに設定できていない  
> - ローカル PASS でも PR で落ちる条件が未定義
> 
> ### P2-001: セマンティック・バージョニング未採用  
> **根本原因**:  
> - SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) が明記されておらず、互換性破壊のルールが不明  
> - リリースごとにバージョン管理が手動・アドホックになっている  
> - 依存関係管理やリリースノート作成が標準化されていない
> 
> ### P1-004: Evidence Pack構成が曖昧  
> **根本原因**:  
> - Evidence Pack の format（diff/manifest/sha256/SBOM）・命名規則・保存パスが未定義  
> - 監査や再現性担保に必要な要素が欠如  
> - 証跡の自動収集・レポート生成が未実装

> ##### 承認手順
> 1. **承認要求作成**: 操作内容・リスク・代替案を明確化
> 2. **承認者通知**: 主要→代理→緊急承認者の優先順位
> 3. **応答期限**: 承認要求後、ルールごとの時間内に応答がない場合自動エスカレーション
> 4. **記録**: 承認結果を `evidence/humangate_approvals/` に保存
> 
> ##### ADR承認フロー
> - **ADR作成者 ≠ 承認者**の原則（自己承認禁止）
> - **承認判断基準**:
>   1. Part00との整合性があるか
>   2. 影響範囲分析が十分か
>   3. ロールバック手順が明確か
> - **承認後**: ADRステータスを「承認済み」に更新し、docs/更新を許可
> ```

> ### 4. 証跡保持方針統一（docs/Part10.md）
> 
> ```markdown
> ### 6.3 証跡の保持・削除ルール
> 
> #### 原則: 証跡は削除しない
> - **MUST**: 全てのVerify証跡は `evidence/verify_reports/` に永続保存（Part12 R-1201に準拠）
> - **SHOULD**: Git管理下に置き、リポジトリ履歴として追跡可能
> 
> #### 整理ルール
> - **推奨**: 証跡ファイルが多すぎる場合、年代別フォルダで整理
>   ```
>   evidence/verify_reports/
>   ├── 2026/
>   │   ├── 01/
>   │   └── 02/
>   └── archive/
>       ├── 2025/
>       └── 2024/
>   ```
> - **禁止**: 証跡ファイルの手動削除（Git履歴からの削除も禁止）
> - **例外**: 誤生成されたFAIL証跡は未追跡のまま放置可
> 
> #### 監査コンプライアンス
> - **最低保持期間**: 90日（FedRAMP要件）[[33](https://www.ignyteplatform.com/blog/fedramp/fedramp-audit-log-retention)]

### P0-001: HumanGate承認者の定義が存在しない

**根本原因**:  
- 役割・責任範囲が明文化されておらず、承認プロセスが手動・アドホックになっている  
- SLA（応答時間）やエスカレーションルートが未定義  
- GitHub の branch protection rules と連携できていない

**影響度評価**:  
- 緊急時に承認者が不在→変更デプロイが72時間以上停止  
- SLA違反ペナルティ：最大 $XX万/日  
- 契約違反による信用失墜

### P0-002: Verifyスクリプトが未実装  
**根本原因**:  
- Part10 で「実装済み前提」としているが、実際の PowerShell コードが存在しない  
- 機械判定可能な品質ゲートが動作しないため、SSOT破壊を検知できない  
- CI/CD パイプラインとの連携も未定義

**影響度評価**:  
- 品質保証システム完全停止  
- 不具合やドキュメント不備が本番に混入するリスク  
- 後工程での手動検証コスト増大

### P0-006: MCPセキュリティが2025年スペック未準拠  
**根本原因**:  
- 2025年6月の OAuth Resource Server 分類、11月の User Consent 必須化に未対応  
- 認証・認可機構が最新セキュリティ標準（OAuth 2.1 + RFC 8707）に準拠していない  
- 機密情報漏洩やコンプライアンス違反のリスク

**影響度評価**:  
- 機密情報（APIキー、個人情報）漏洩  
- 外部監査での指摘是正コスト  
- 信頼失墜によるビジネス機会損失

### P0-003/P0-004: 証跡保持方針とファイル形式の矛盾  
**根本原因**:  
- Part10 と Part12 で証跡保持方針（削除 vs 永続）が相反  
- 拡張子（.txt vs .md）の不統一で監査ツールが証跡を検知できない  
- 保持期間やローテーションポリシーが未定義

**影響度評価**:  
- 監査時に「証跡 lost」として FAIL 判定  
- コンプライアンス（FedRAMP, SOX, ISO27001）違反  
- ディスク容量圧迫と管理コスト増大

### P1-001: HumanGate承認フロー未定義  
**根本原因**:  
- Part00 U-0001「ADR承認フロー」が未解決のまま放置  
- ADR作成→レビュー→承認→反映のプロセスが標準化されていない  
- 承認基準（誰が、何を、どのタイミングで）が不明

### P0-1: ブランチ名義が不明確  
**根本原因**:  
- ブランチ命名規則（feat/123 vs feature/fix-bug）が統一されていない  
- Git flow と GitHub flow の混在で、PRマージや競合解消の工数が増加  
- branch protection rules がパターンマッチで制限できていない

### P1-005: CI/CD連携の明記不足  
**根本原因**:  
- GitHub Actions など CI ツールとの連携が不明確  
- Verify Gate を PR マージ前の必須チェックに設定できていない  
- ローカル PASS でも PR で落ちる条件が未定義

### P2-001: セマンティック・バージョニング未採用  
**根本原因**:  
- SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) が明記されておらず、互換性破壊のルールが不明  
- リリースごとにバージョン管理が手動・アドホックになっている  
- 依存関係管理やリリースノート作成が標準化されていない

### P1-004: Evidence Pack構成が曖昧  
**根本原因**:  
- Evidence Pack の format（diff/manifest/sha256/SBOM）・命名規則・保存パスが未定義  
- 監査や再現性担保に必要な要素が欠如  
- 証跡の自動収集・レポート生成が未実装

## B. 設計書への追記案（詳細実装コード付き）

### 1. HumanGate承認フロー明確化（docs/Part09.md）

```markdown
#### 5.1.5 HumanGate承認フロー

##### 承認者マトリックス（`decisions/approver-matrix.yml`）
```yaml
# decisions/approver-matrix.yml
approval_matrix:
  critical_changes:
    - pattern: "docs/Part0*.md"
      approvers: ["tech-lead", "security-lead"]
      min_approvals: 2
      timeout: 24h
    - pattern: "sources/"
      approvers: ["security-lead", "compliance-officer"]
      min_approvals: 2
      timeout: 12h
  
  normal_changes:
    - pattern: "docs/Part[1-9]*.md"
      approvers: ["tech-lead"]
      min_approvals: 1
      timeout: 48h
  
  emergency_changes:
    - pattern: "**"
      approvers: ["emergency-team"]
      min_approvals: 1
      timeout: 2h
```

##### 自動承認チェックスクリプト（`scripts/check_humangate_approval.py`）
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import yaml
import github
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import sys

class HumanGateChecker:
    def __init__(self, config_path="decisions/approver-matrix.yml"):
        with open(config_path) as f:
            self.config = yaml.safe_load(f)
        self.gh = github.Github(os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN"))
    
    def _determine_approval_rule(self, files_changed):
        for rule in self.config['approval_matrix']['critical_changes']:
            if any(f.startswith(rule['pattern'].rstrip('*')) for f in files_changed):
                return rule
        for rule in self.config['approval_matrix']['normal_changes']:
            if any(f.startswith(rule['pattern'].rstrip('*')) for f in files_changed):
                return rule
        return self.config['approval_matrix']['emergency_changes'][0]
    
    def check_approval_status(self, pr_number):
        repo = self.gh.get_repo(os.getenv("GITHUB_REPOSITORY"))
        pr = repo.get_pull(pr_number)
        files_changed = [f.filename for f in pr.get_files()]
        
        rule = self._determine_approval_rule(files_changed)
        approvals = [r for r in pr.get_reviews() if r.state == "APPROVED"]
        approved_by = set(r.user.login for r in approvals)
        
        if len(approved_by) >= rule['min_approvals']:
            return "APPROVED"
        
        if datetime.utcnow() - pr.created_at > timedelta(hours=rule['timeout']):
            return "ESCALATED"
        
        return "PENDING"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    checker = HumanGateChecker()
    status = checker.check_approval_status(int(sys.argv[1]))
    print(status)
    if status == "ESCALATED":
        sys.exit(1)
```

##### GitHub Actions連携（`.github/workflows/humangate-approval.yml`）
```yaml
name: HumanGate Approval Check
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  check-approval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check HumanGate Approval
        run: |
          python scripts/check_humangate_approval.py ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

##### 承認手順
1. **承認要求作成**: 操作内容・リスク・代替案を明確化
2. **承認者通知**: 主要→代理→緊急承認者の優先順位
3. **応答期限**: 承認要求後、ルールごとの時間内に応答がない場合自動エスカレーション
4. **記録**: 承認結果を `evidence/humangate_approvals/` に保存

##### ADR承認フロー
- **ADR作成者 ≠ 承認者**の原則（自己承認禁止）
- **承認判断基準**:
  1. Part00との整合性があるか
  2. 影響範囲分析が十分か
  3. ロールバック手順が明確か
- **承認後**: ADRステータスを「承認済み」に更新し、docs/更新を許可
```

### 4. 証跡保持方針統一（docs/Part10.md）

```markdown
### 6.3 証跡の保持・削除ルール

#### 原則: 証跡は削除しない
- **MUST**: 全てのVerify証跡は `evidence/verify_reports/` に永続保存（Part12 R-1201に準拠）
- **SHOULD**: Git管理下に置き、リポジトリ履歴として追跡可能

#### 整理ルール
- **推奨**: 証跡ファイルが多すぎる場合、年代別フォルダで整理
  ```
  evidence/verify_reports/
  ├── 2026/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   └── 02/
  └── archive/
      ├── 2025/
      └── 2024/
  ```
- **禁止**: 証跡ファイルの手動削除（Git履歴からの削除も禁止）
